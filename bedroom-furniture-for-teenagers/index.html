<h3>
  Durability
</h3>

  Teenagers are tough on furniture. They jump on beds, throw their clothes around, and generally use their furniture in ways that adults would never dream of. That's why it's important to choose furniture that is durable and can withstand the wear and tear of teenage life.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Solid construction:</strong> Look for furniture that is made from solid wood or metal. These materials are more durable than particleboard or MDF, and they are less likely to break or warp over time.

  <li>
    <strong>Strong joints:</strong> The joints of furniture are where it is most likely to break. Make sure the joints are reinforced with glue, screws, or bolts, and that they are tight and secure.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Durable fabrics:</strong> If you choose furniture with upholstered cushions, make sure the fabric is durable and easy to clean. Look for fabrics that are stain-resistant and fade-resistant, and that can withstand being jumped on and spilled on.

  <li>
    <strong>Proper care:</strong> Even the most durable furniture will need proper care to last. Make sure to clean your teenager's furniture regularly, and avoid using harsh chemicals or cleaners.

  By choosing durable furniture, you can save money in the long run and ensure that your teenager's furniture will last for years to come.
