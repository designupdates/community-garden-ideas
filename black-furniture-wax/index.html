  Tips

<p>
  Here are some tips for using black furniture wax on garden furniture:
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Tip 1: Clean the furniture before applying the wax.</em></strong><br />
  This will help to remove any dirt or debris that could interfere with the wax's adhesion.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Tip 2: Apply the wax in a thin, even coat.</em></strong><br />
  A thin coat of wax will be more effective than a thick coat, and it will be less likely to streak or drip.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Tip 3: Allow the wax to dry completely before buffing it.</em></strong><br />
  This will help to ensure that the wax has had time to penetrate the wood and form a protective barrier.

<p>
  <strong><em>Tip 4: Reapply the wax every few months, or more often if the furniture is exposed to harsh weather conditions.</em></strong><br />
  This will help to keep the furniture protected from the elements and looking its best.
