<h3>
  Durable and sturdy
</h3>
<p>
  Aluminium rattan garden furniture is designed to withstand the elements and last for many years to come. Here are four reasons why it is so durable and sturdy:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Aluminium frame:</strong> The frames of aluminium rattan garden furniture are made of high-quality aluminium, which is a strong and lightweight metal. Aluminium is resistant to rust and corrosion, making it ideal for outdoor use.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Powder-coated finish:</strong> The aluminium frames are powder-coated, which further protects them from the elements. Powder-coating is a process in which a dry powder is applied to the metal and then cured at a high temperature. This creates a durable and long-lasting finish that is resistant to chipping, peeling, and fading.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Rattan wicker:</strong> The rattan wicker used in aluminium rattan garden furniture is made of high-density polyethylene (HDPE). HDPE is a strong and durable plastic that is resistant to UV rays and moisture. It is also colourfast, meaning that it will not fade over time.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Expert craftsmanship:</strong> Aluminium rattan garden furniture is made by skilled craftsmen who use high-quality materials and construction techniques. This ensures that the furniture is built to last and can withstand regular use.

  The lightweight nature of aluminium rattan garden furniture is due to the use of aluminium in the frame. Aluminium is a very lightweight metal, which makes the furniture easy to lift and move around.
</p>
<p>
  In addition, the rattan wicker used in aluminium rattan garden furniture is also very lightweight. Rattan is a natural material that is made from the stems of the rattan palm. It is a very strong and durable material, but it is also very lightweight.
</p>
<p>
  The combination of a lightweight aluminium frame and lightweight rattan wicker makes aluminium rattan garden furniture very easy to move. This is a great advantage if you need to move the furniture around your patio or deck, or if you need to store it away during the winter months.
</p>
