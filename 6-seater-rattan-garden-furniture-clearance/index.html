<h3>
  High-quality rattan material
</h3>
<p>
  When choosing 6-seater rattan garden furniture on clearance, it's crucial to consider the quality of the rattan material. High-quality rattan is durable, weather-resistant, and can withstand the elements for many years to come.
</p>
<p>
  Look for rattan furniture made from natural materials such as wicker, bamboo, or polyethylene (PE) rattan. These materials are known for their strength and resistance to fading, cracking, and peeling.
</p>
<p>
  Natural rattan is a sustainable choice as it is a renewable resource. It is also biodegradable and recyclable, making it an environmentally friendly option.
</p>
<p>
  PE rattan, on the other hand, is a synthetic material that mimics the look and feel of natural rattan. It is highly durable and resistant to water, UV rays, and insects, making it ideal for outdoor use.
</p>
<p>
  By choosing 6-seater rattan garden furniture made from high-quality materials, you can ensure that your furniture will last for many years and provide you with years of enjoyment.
</p>
<h3>
  Sturdy and weather-resistant frames
</h3>

  When choosing 6-seater rattan garden furniture on clearance, it's important to consider the sturdiness and weather resistance of the frames. Sturdy frames ensure that your furniture can withstand regular use and harsh weather conditions.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Powder-coated aluminum frames</strong><br />
    <p>
      Powder-coated aluminum frames are lightweight, rust-resistant, and durable. They are also easy to clean and maintain.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Galvanized steel frames</strong><br />
    <p>
      Galvanized steel frames are strong and corrosion-resistant, making them ideal for outdoor use. They are also relatively inexpensive.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Teak wood frames</strong><br />
    <p>
      Teak wood frames are naturally weather-resistant and durable. They are also beautiful and add a touch of luxury to your outdoor space.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Polyethylene (PE) rattan frames</strong><br />
    <p>
      PE rattan frames are lightweight, durable, and weather-resistant. They are also UV-resistant, so they will not fade or crack in the sun.
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
