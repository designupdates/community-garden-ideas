<p>
  In many cultures, funerals are seen as a sacred and solemn occasion, marked by elaborate ceremonies and rituals.

They also maintain the graves by mowing the grass, trimming trees and shrubs, and repairing any damage. <strong>Infrastructure and facilities:</strong> Cemeteries often have roads, pathways, and other infrastructure that need to be maintained. They may also have buildings such as chapels, mausoleums, and crematoria that require upkeep. <strong>Environmental stewardship:</strong> Cemeteries play an important role in environmental stewardship. They can provide habitat for wildlife, serve as green spaces in urban areas, and help to reduce erosion and flooding.
<p>
  Cemetery maintenance is an ongoing process that requires careful attention to detail. Cemeteries must be kept clean, safe, and accessible for visitors, while also respecting the sanctity of the burial grounds.
