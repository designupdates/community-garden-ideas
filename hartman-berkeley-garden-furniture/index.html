<p>
  <strong>Tip 3: Prioritize comfort and functionality:</strong><br />
  When choosing garden furniture, prioritize comfort and functionality. Look for pieces that are comfortable to sit in and that meet your needs. If you plan on entertaining guests, choose pieces that are easy to move and rearrange. Consider adding cushions, pillows, and throws to make your furniture even more comfortable.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Tip 4: Protect your furniture from the elements:</strong><br />
  To extend the life of your garden furniture, protect it from the elements. Use covers or cushions when the furniture is not in use, and store it indoors or in a sheltered location during the off-season. Clean your furniture regularly with mild soap and water, and apply a sealant or protectant to help protect it from the sun, rain, and other harsh weather conditions.
