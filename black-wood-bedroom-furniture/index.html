  Tips
</h3>
<p>
  Here are four practical tips to help you make the most of your garden furniture and create a stylish and inviting outdoor space:
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Tip 1: Choose the right location:</strong><br />
  When placing your garden furniture, consider the amount of sunlight and shade in the area. If you prefer to relax in the sun, choose a spot that gets plenty of sunlight.
