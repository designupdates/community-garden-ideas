  FAQ
</h3>
<p>
  Have questions about our garden furniture? We've got answers! Here are some of the most frequently asked questions about our garden furniture, along with their answers.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Question 1: What materials are your garden furniture made from?</em></strong><br />
  Answer 1: Our garden furniture is made from a variety of materials, including teak, acacia, and aluminum. Teak is a durable hardwood that is naturally resistant to rot and decay, making it ideal for outdoor use. Acacia is another durable hardwood that is also resistant to insects and pests. Aluminum is a lightweight and rust-resistant metal that is perfect for outdoor furniture.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Question 2: How do I care for my garden furniture?</em></strong><br />
  Answer 2: To care for your garden furniture, simply clean it with a mild soap and water solution. You can also use a teak cleaner to protect and preserve the wood. Avoid using harsh chemicals or abrasive cleaners, as these can damage the furniture.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Question 3: Can I leave my garden furniture outside all year round?</em></strong><br />
  Answer 3: Yes, our garden furniture is designed to withstand all types of weather conditions. However, we recommend storing your furniture indoors or covering it with a protective cover during the winter months to extend its lifespan.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Question 4: What is your return policy?</em></strong><br />
  Answer 4: We offer a 30-day return policy on all of our garden furniture. If you are not satisfied with your purchase, simply return it to us within 30 days for a full refund.
</p>
<p>

  Tips
</h3>
<p>
  Choosing the right garden furniture can be a daunting task, but it doesn't have to be. Here are four tips to help you choose the perfect pieces for your outdoor space:
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Tip 1: Consider your needs.</strong> What do you plan to use your garden furniture for? Do you need a place to relax and entertain guests, or do you need a more functional space for dining or cooking? Once you know how you will be using your garden furniture, you can start to narrow down your choices.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Tip 2: Choose the right materials.</strong> Garden furniture is made from a variety of materials, each with its own advantages and disadvantages. Teak is a durable hardwood that is naturally resistant to rot and decay, making it ideal for outdoor use. Acacia is another durable hardwood that is also resistant to insects and pests. Aluminum is a lightweight and rust-resistant metal that is perfect for outdoor furniture. Wicker is a natural material that is both stylish and comfortable.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Tip 3: Pay attention to comfort.</strong> You want your garden furniture to be comfortable to sit in, especially if you plan on spending long hours outdoors. Look for furniture with comfortable cushions and supportive frames. You may also want to consider adding a few throws or pillows to make your furniture even more comfortable.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Tip 4: Don't forget about style.</strong> Your garden furniture should complement the style of your home and outdoor space. If you have a traditional home, you may want to choose classic garden furniture made from wood or metal. If you have a more modern home, you may want to choose contemporary garden furniture made from aluminum or wicker.
