    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Proper monitor placement:</strong><br />
    <p>
      Position your monitor so that the top of the screen is at or slightly below eye level. This will help you avoid neck strain.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Footrests:</strong><br />
    <p>
      If your feet don't reach the floor comfortably, use a footrest to support them. This will help to improve your circulation and reduce leg fatigue.

  By investing in ergonomic furniture, you can create a workspace that is both comfortable and productive. Your body will thank you!
