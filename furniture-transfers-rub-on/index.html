  <strong>Tip 1: Choose the right furniture.</strong> When choosing garden furniture, look for pieces that are made from durable materials that can withstand the elements. Avoid furniture made from materials that are prone to rust or rot, such as metal or wood that is not properly treated.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Tip 2: Protect your furniture from the sun.</strong> The sun's UV rays can damage garden furniture over time, causing it to fade and become brittle. To protect your furniture from the sun, use a furniture cover or place it in a shaded area.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Tip 3: Clean your furniture regularly.</strong> Dirt and debris can build up on garden furniture over time, which can damage the finish and make it more susceptible to wear and tear. To prevent this, clean your furniture regularly with a mild detergent and water.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Tip 4: Store your furniture properly.</strong> When you are not using your garden furniture, store it in a dry place where it will be protected from the elements. If you do not have a shed or garage, you can use a furniture cover to protect your furniture from the rain and snow.
