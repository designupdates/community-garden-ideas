Mixing styles adds visual interest and allows you to express your creativity.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Tip 4: Create a Focal Point:</strong> Incorporate a focal point in your garden seating area to draw the eye and create a sense of cohesion. This could be a stunning piece of furniture, a water feature, or even a beautiful plant or sculpture. Arranging your furniture around the focal point will help create a natural flow and make your outdoor space more inviting.
