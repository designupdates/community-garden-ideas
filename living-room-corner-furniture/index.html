<p>
  One of the most important things to consider when choosing living room corner furniture is the size. You want to make sure that the pieces you choose will fit comfortably in the corner of your room without overcrowding it. To do this, you need to measure the corner of your room before you start shopping.
</p>
<p>
  To measure the corner of your room, simply measure the length of the two walls that form the corner. Then, add the two measurements together. This will give you the total length of the corner.
</p>
<p>
  Once you know the total length of the corner, you can start shopping for furniture. When choosing furniture, keep in mind that you will need to leave some space between the furniture and the walls. This will allow you to move around the furniture easily and avoid overcrowding the space.
</p>
<p>
  A good rule of thumb is to leave at least 6 inches of space between the furniture and the walls. This will give you enough room to move around comfortably and avoid feeling cramped.

</h3>
<p>
  When purchasing corner furniture, it's important to make sure that the furniture comes with a warranty. A warranty is a guarantee that the furniture will be free from defects for a certain period of time. If the furniture is damaged or defective during the warranty period, the manufacturer will repair or replace the furniture free of charge.

    <strong>Length of the warranty:</strong> The length of the warranty is an important factor to consider. Some warranties only cover the furniture for a year or two, while other warranties cover the furniture for five years or more. The longer the warranty, the more protection you have in case the furniture is damaged or defective.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Coverage of the warranty:</strong> The coverage of the warranty is also an important factor to consider. Some warranties only cover the frame of the furniture, while other warranties cover the entire piece of furniture, including the upholstery and the cushions. Make sure that the warranty covers the parts of the furniture that are most likely to be damaged or defective.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Exclusions of the warranty:</strong> Some warranties have exclusions that limit the coverage of the warranty. For example, some warranties do not cover damage caused by normal wear and tear. Make sure that you read the warranty carefully to understand what is and is not covered.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Customer service of the manufacturer:</strong> If you have a problem with your corner furniture, you will need to contact the manufacturer to file a warranty claim. Make sure that the manufacturer has good customer service and that they are easy to reach.
