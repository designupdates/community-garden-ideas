  <strong>Tip 4: Care for your furniture:</strong><br />
  To keep your garden furniture looking its best and lasting for many years to come, follow these care tips: * **Clean your furniture regularly:** Clean your furniture regularly with a mild soap and water solution. You may also want to apply a sealant or stain to wooden furniture to protect it from the elements. Metal furniture can be protected with a rust-resistant coating. Resin furniture is generally low-maintenance and can be cleaned with a mild soap and water solution. * **Store your furniture properly:** If you live in an area with harsh winters, you should store your garden furniture indoors during the winter months. If you don't have indoor storage space, you can cover your furniture with weather-resistant covers.
