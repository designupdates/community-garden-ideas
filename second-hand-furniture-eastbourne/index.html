</p>
<p>
  <strong>Tip 2: Choose Durable and Weather-Resistant Materials:</strong><br />

  Comfort is paramount when it comes to garden furniture. Select pieces with ergonomic designs and ample cushioning. Consider adjustable features, such as reclining chairs or extendable tables, to enhance functionality and cater to different needs.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Tip 4: Create a Cohesive Look:</strong><br />
  To achieve a cohesive and stylish look, select garden furniture pieces that complement each other in terms of design, color, and material. Incorporate outdoor accessories like cushions, throws, and plants to add pops of color and texture, creating a welcoming and inviting atmosphere.
