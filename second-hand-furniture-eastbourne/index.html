</p>
<p>
  <strong>Tip 2: Choose Durable and Weather-Resistant Materials:</strong><br />

<p>
  <strong>Tip 4: Create a Cohesive Look:</strong><br />
  To achieve a cohesive and stylish look, select garden furniture pieces that complement each other in terms of design, color, and material. Incorporate outdoor accessories like cushions, throws, and plants to add pops of color and texture, creating a welcoming and inviting atmosphere.
