  Tips
</h3>
<p>
  Here are four practical tips to help you choose and care for your garden furniture:
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Tip 1: Choose the right material.</strong> Garden furniture comes in a variety of materials, including wood, metal, plastic, and wicker. Each material has its own advantages and disadvantages, so it's important to choose the one that's right for your needs. For example, wood is a classic choice that is both durable and stylish. However, it requires more maintenance than other materials, such as metal or plastic.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Tip 2: Consider your climate.</strong> If you live in a climate with harsh winters, you'll need to choose furniture that is weather-resistant. Metal and plastic furniture are good choices for these climates, as they are not affected by rain or snow. Wood furniture can also be used in these climates, but it will need to be treated with a sealant to protect it from the elements.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Tip 3: Measure your space.</strong> Before you start shopping for garden furniture, it's important to measure your outdoor space. This will help you determine how much furniture you can fit in the space and what size furniture will work best.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Tip 4: Don't forget the cushions.</strong> Cushions can make your garden furniture more comfortable and stylish. When choosing cushions, be sure to select a fabric that is weather-resistant and easy to clean.
