<h3>
  Hollowed-out log
</h3>
<p>
  The first step in making tympanic furniture is to hollow out a log. This can be done with a variety of tools, including an axe, a chisel, and a drill. The log should be hollowed out to a depth of about 2 inches, and the inside should be sanded smooth.
</p>
<p>
  Once the log is hollowed out, it is time to cover the opening with a piece of fabric or leather. The fabric or leather should be stretched tightly over the opening and secured with tacks or staples. The fabric or leather will serve as the drumhead, and it will vibrate when struck with a drumstick.
</p>
<p>
  The final step is to attach the tympanic furniture to a stand. The stand can be made from a variety of materials, including wood, metal, or plastic. The stand should be sturdy enough to support the weight of the tympanic furniture, and it should be adjustable so that the furniture can be played at a comfortable height.

The fabric or leather will serve as the drumhead, and it will vibrate when struck with a drumstick.

<p>
  The type of fabric or leather that you use will affect the sound of the drum. Thicker fabrics will produce a lower sound, while thinner fabrics will produce a higher sound. You can also experiment with different types of fabric or leather to create different sounds.
</p>
<p>
  Once you have covered the opening with fabric or leather, you can begin to decorate the tympanic furniture. You can paint it, stain it, or add other embellishments. You can also add a stand to the tympanic furniture so that it can be played at a comfortable height.

If you will be using the furniture for entertaining, you will want to choose pieces that are comfortable and stylish.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Tip 4: Choose the right style.</strong><br />
  The style of your garden furniture should match the style of your home and garden. If you have a traditional-style home, you will want to choose traditional-style garden furniture.
