</p>
<p>
  Make sure you have accurate measurements of your outdoor space before purchasing garden furniture. This will help you choose pieces that fit comfortably and proportionally in your space.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Tip 3: Consider the purpose of the furniture.</strong>
</p>
<p>
  Think about how you plan to use your garden furniture. If you're looking for a place to relax and lounge, you might choose comfortable lounge chairs or a hammock. If you're planning on dining outdoors, you'll need a dining table and chairs that can accommodate your guests.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Tip 4: Protect your furniture from the elements.</strong>
</p>
<p>
  To keep your garden furniture looking its best and lasting for years to come, protect it from the elements. Apply a sealant or protector to wooden furniture to protect it from the sun and rain. Store cushions and pillows indoors when not in use to prevent fading and mildew. If you live in an area with harsh weather conditions, consider covering your garden furniture during the off-season.
</p>
<p>
  By following these tips, you can choose, care for, and enjoy your garden furniture for years to come.
</p>
<p>
  With a little care and attention, your garden furniture can become a beloved part of your outdoor living space, providing you with years of relaxation and enjoyment.
</p>
