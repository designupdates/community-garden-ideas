</p>
<p>
  <strong>Measure your outdoor space.</strong> This will give you a good idea of how much furniture you can fit. Be sure to measure the length, width, and height of the space.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Consider the flow of traffic.</strong> You don't want to place furniture in a way that blocks the flow of traffic. Make sure there is enough space for people to move around easily.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Think about the purpose of the space.</strong> Are you using the space for dining, entertaining, or relaxing? This will help you determine what type of furniture you need.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Choose furniture that is the right size for the space.</strong> You don't want to choose furniture that is too large or too small. It should be comfortable and proportionate to the size of the space.
</p>
<p>

</p>
<h3>
  Consider the style of your home and garden.

  When hiring garden furniture, it's important to consider the style of your home and garden. You want to choose furniture that complements the overall look and feel of your property. Here are a few things to keep in mind:
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Traditional style homes</strong> are typically paired with classic garden furniture made from materials such as wrought iron, teak, or wicker. This type of furniture is often ornate and features intricate details.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Modern style homes</strong> are often paired with contemporary garden furniture made from materials such as aluminum, stainless steel, or concrete. This type of furniture is typically sleek and minimalist in design.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Rustic style homes</strong> are typically paired with garden furniture made from natural materials such as wood, stone, or bamboo. This type of furniture is often simple and unadorned.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Tropical style homes</strong> are typically paired with garden furniture made from materials such as rattan, bamboo, or palm leaves. This type of furniture is often colorful and features tropical motifs.
</p>
