</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>FSC-certified wood</strong><br />
    <p>
      All of the wood we use in our frames is FSC-certified, which means that it comes from responsibly managed forests. FSC certification ensures that the forests are harvested in a way that minimizes environmental impact and protects biodiversity.

    <strong>Recycled materials</strong><br />
    <p>
      We use recycled materials whenever possible, such as recycled plastic and metal. This helps to reduce our environmental footprint and conserve natural resources.

  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Low-VOC finishes</strong><br />
    <p>
      The finishes we use on our furniture are low in VOCs (volatile organic compounds). VOCs are harmful air pollutants that can contribute to respiratory problems and other health issues. Our low-VOC finishes help to create a healthier indoor environment for you and your family.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Sustainable fabrics</strong><br />
    <p>
      We offer a wide range of sustainable fabrics for our upholstery, including organic cotton, hemp, and recycled polyester. These fabrics are not only durable and beautiful, but they also have a lower environmental impact than traditional fabrics.
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
