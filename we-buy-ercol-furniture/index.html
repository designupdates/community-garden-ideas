    <strong>Sell to the right buyer.</strong> There are many different ways to sell your Ercol furniture, from selling it online to selling it to a local consignment shop. Choose the selling method that's right for you based on your needs and preferences.

  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Be patient.</strong> Selling your Ercol furniture may take some time, especially if you're looking for a specific price. Don't get discouraged if your furniture doesn't sell right away. Just be patient and keep marketing it until you find the right buyer.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Get help from a professional.</strong> If you're having trouble selling your Ercol furniture on your own, you may want to consider getting help from a professional. A furniture consignment shop can help you price your furniture, market it to potential buyers, and handle the sale for you.

    <strong>Enjoy the process.</strong> Selling your Ercol furniture should be an enjoyable experience. Take your time, do your research, and find the right buyer for your pieces. With a little effort, you can get a fair price for your furniture and find it a new home where it will be loved and appreciated.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  Selling your Ercol furniture doesn't have to be a difficult process. By following these tips, you can get the most value for your pieces and find them a new home where they will be cherished.
</p>
<h3>
  Know your furniture. Do some research to find out more about the age, style, and condition of your Ercol pieces. This information will help you determine a fair asking price.
</h3>
<p>
  Before you list your Ercol furniture for sale, it's important to do your research and find out as much as you can about each piece. This information will help you determine a fair asking price and will also be helpful to potential buyers.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>The age of your Ercol furniture.</strong> Ercol furniture has been produced for over 100 years, so the age of your piece will have a significant impact on its value. Older pieces are generally more valuable than newer pieces, but this is not always the case. Some newer Ercol pieces are more rare and desirable than older pieces, so it's important to do your research to find out how old your piece is and how much it is worth.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>The style of your Ercol furniture.</strong> Ercol furniture is available in a variety of styles, from traditional to modern. The style of your piece will also affect its value. Traditional Ercol pieces are generally more popular than modern pieces, but this is not always the case. Some modern Ercol pieces are very rare and desirable, so it's important to do your research to find out how much your piece is worth.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>The condition of your Ercol furniture.</strong> The condition of your Ercol furniture will also affect its value. Pieces that are in good condition are generally worth more than pieces that are in poor condition. However, even pieces that are in poor condition can be valuable if they are rare or desirable. It's important to assess the condition of your Ercol furniture carefully and to price it accordingly.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>The provenance of your Ercol furniture.</strong> If you know the provenance of your Ercol furniture, this can also affect its value. Pieces that have been owned by famous people or that have been featured in magazines or books are generally worth more than pieces that do not have a known provenance. However, it's important to note that provenance is not always a guarantee of value. Some pieces with a known provenance may not be worth very much, while some pieces with no known provenance may be very valuable.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  Once you have done your research and gathered all of the necessary information about your Ercol furniture, you can start to determine a fair asking price. It's important to remember that the value of Ercol furniture is subjective and can vary depending on a number of factors. However, by doing your research and pricing your furniture accordingly, you can increase your chances of getting a fair price for your pieces.
</p>
<h3>
  Take good photos. When listing your Ercol furniture for sale, be sure to take clear, well-lit photos of each piece. This will help potential buyers see the condition of your furniture and make an informed decision about whether or not to purchase it.
</h3>
<p>
  One of the most important things you can do when selling your Ercol furniture is to take good photos. Clear, well-lit photos will help potential buyers see the condition of your furniture and make an informed decision about whether or not to purchase it. Here are a few tips for taking good photos of your Ercol furniture:
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Use natural light.</strong> If possible, take your photos outside in natural light. This will give your photos a bright and airy look and will help potential buyers see the true color of your furniture. If you must take your photos indoors, use a well-lit room with plenty of natural light.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Use a high-quality camera.</strong> The better the camera you use, the better your photos will be. If you have a DSLR camera, use it. If you don't have a DSLR camera, use the best camera you have available.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Take close-up photos.</strong> Potential buyers will want to see the details of your furniture, so be sure to take close-up photos of any unique features or details. This will help potential buyers see the quality of your furniture and make an informed decision about whether or not to purchase it.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Take multiple photos.</strong> Take several photos of each piece of furniture from different angles. This will give potential buyers a good sense of the size and shape of your furniture and will help them see all of its features.
</p>
<p>
  Once you have taken your photos, be sure to edit them to make them look their best. You can use a photo editing software program to crop your photos, adjust the brightness and contrast, and remove any unwanted objects. Once you are happy with your photos, you can upload them to your listing.
</p>
<h3>
  Write a detailed description. In addition to taking good photos, be sure to write a detailed description of each piece of Ercol furniture you're selling. This description should include the age, style, condition, and dimensions of the piece, as well as any other relevant information.
</h3>
<p>
  In addition to taking good photos, it's also important to write a detailed description of each piece of Ercol furniture you're selling. This description should include the following information:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>The age of the piece.</strong> If you know the age of your Ercol furniture, be sure to include it in the description. This information will be helpful to potential buyers who are looking for pieces from a specific era.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>The style of the piece.</strong> Ercol furniture is available in a variety of styles, from traditional to modern. Be sure to describe the style of your piece so that potential buyers can easily find what they're looking for.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>The condition of the piece.</strong> Be honest about the condition of your Ercol furniture. If the piece has any scratches, dents, or other damage, be sure to mention it in the description. This will help potential buyers make an informed decision about whether or not to purchase the piece.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>The dimensions of the piece.</strong> Be sure to include the dimensions of your Ercol furniture in the description. This information will help potential buyers determine if the piece will fit in their space.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  In addition to the above information, you may also want to include any other relevant information about your Ercol furniture in the description. For example, if the piece has been reupholstered or refinished, be sure to mention it. You may also want to include any information about the provenance of the piece, if known.
</p>

  Once you have gathered all of the necessary information about your Ercol furniture, it's time to set a price. It's important to find a balance between getting a fair price for your pieces and attracting potential buyers. Here are a few tips for pricing your Ercol furniture:
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Do your research.</strong> The first step to pricing your Ercol furniture is to do your research. Find out what similar pieces are selling for online and in stores. This will give you a good idea of what your furniture is worth.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Consider the condition of your furniture.</strong> The condition of your furniture will also affect its price. Pieces that are in good condition are generally worth more than pieces that are in poor condition. However, even pieces that are in poor condition can be valuable if they are rare or desirable.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Set a price that you are comfortable with.</strong> Once you have considered all of the factors that affect the price of your Ercol furniture, it's time to set a price that you are comfortable with. It's important to remember that the value of Ercol furniture is subjective and can vary depending on a number of factors. However, by doing your research and pricing your furniture accordingly, you can increase your chances of getting a fair price for your pieces.
</p>
<p>
  If you are unsure about how to price your Ercol furniture, you may want to consider getting a professional appraisal. A professional appraiser can assess the value of your furniture and provide you with a fair market value.
</p>
<h3>

<p>
  It's unlikely that you'll get your asking price for every piece of Ercol furniture you sell. Be prepared to negotiate with potential buyers, but don't be afraid to walk away from a deal if you're not happy with the price.
</p>
<p>
  Here are a few tips for negotiating the price of your Ercol furniture:
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Be willing to compromise.</strong> It's unlikely that you'll get your full asking price, so be willing to compromise. Be prepared to meet potential buyers halfway on the price, or even come down a little bit more if necessary.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Be confident.</strong> When negotiating the price of your Ercol furniture, be confident in your knowledge of the value of your pieces. Don't be afraid to stand your ground and walk away from a deal if you're not happy with the price.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Be prepared to walk away.</strong> If you're not happy with the price that a potential buyer is offering, be prepared to walk away from the deal. There are plenty of other potential buyers out there, so don't feel pressured to sell your furniture for less than you think it's worth.
</p>
<p>
  Negotiating the price of your Ercol furniture can be a bit nerve-wracking, but it's important to remember that you're in control of the sale. If you're not happy with the price that a potential buyer is offering, don't be afraid to walk away. There are plenty of other potential buyers out there, and you're sure to find someone who is willing to pay a fair price for your furniture.
</p>
<h3>
  Sell to the right buyer. There are many different ways to sell your Ercol furniture, from selling it online to selling it to a local consignment shop. Choose the selling method that's right for you based on your needs and preferences.
</h3>
<p>
  There are many different ways to sell your Ercol furniture, each with its own advantages and disadvantages. Here are a few of the most popular methods:
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Selling online.</strong> Selling your Ercol furniture online is a great way to reach a large audience of potential buyers. There are many different online marketplaces where you can list your furniture, such as eBay, Craigslist, and Facebook Marketplace. When selling online, it's important to take good photos of your furniture and write a detailed description. You should also be prepared to ship your furniture to buyers who are not local.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Selling to a local consignment shop.</strong> Consignment shops are a great option for selling your Ercol furniture if you don't want to deal with the hassle of selling it yourself. Consignment shops will typically take a percentage of the sale price of your furniture, but they will handle all of the marketing and sales for you. When selling to a consignment shop, it's important to choose a shop that is reputable and has a good track record of selling Ercol furniture.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Selling to a local furniture store.</strong> Some local furniture stores will also buy used Ercol furniture. This is a great option if you want to get a quick and easy sale. However, local furniture stores will typically offer you less money for your furniture than you would get if you sold it online or to a consignment shop.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Selling to a private buyer.</strong> You can also sell your Ercol furniture to a private buyer. This is a great option if you want to get the most money for your furniture. However, it can be more difficult to find a private buyer who is interested in your furniture.
</p>
<p>
  The best way to sell your Ercol furniture depends on your individual needs and preferences. If you want to get the most money for your furniture, selling it online or to a private buyer is a good option. However, if you want a quick and easy sale, selling it to a local consignment shop or furniture store is a better choice.
</p>
<h3>
  Get your furniture ready for sale. Before you list your Ercol furniture for sale, be sure to clean it and make any necessary repairs. This will help your furniture look its best and attract potential buyers.
</h3>
<p>
  Before you list your Ercol furniture for sale, it's important to get it ready for sale. This means cleaning it and making any necessary repairs.
</p>
<p>
  To clean your Ercol furniture, use a mild soap and water solution. Avoid using harsh chemicals, as these can damage the finish of your furniture. Once you have cleaned your furniture, dry it thoroughly with a clean cloth.
