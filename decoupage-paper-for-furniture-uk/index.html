  <strong>Tip 2: Prepare your furniture properly:</strong><br />
  Before applying decoupage paper, make sure your garden furniture is clean, dry, and free of any dirt or debris. If the surface is glossy, you may need to sand it lightly to create a better surface for the decoupage paper to adhere to.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Tip 3: Use the right glue:</strong><br />
  Choose a decoupage glue or varnish that is specifically designed for outdoor use. These glues are weather-resistant and will help the decoupage paper stay adhered to your furniture even in harsh conditions.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Tip 4: Apply multiple layers of sealant:</strong><br />
  Once you have applied the decoupage paper to your garden furniture, apply multiple layers of decoupage sealant or varnish. This will provide extra protection against the elements and help your designs last even longer.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Tip 5: Consider using a primer:</strong><br />
  If you are applying decoupage paper to metal garden furniture, consider using a primer designed for metal surfaces. This will help the decoupage paper adhere better to the metal and prevent peeling or chipping.
</p>
<p>
  Closing Paragraph for Tips: By following these tips, you can ensure that your decoupage paper projects on your garden furniture turn out beautifully and last for many seasons to come.
