  <strong>Tip 1: Choose the right paint:</strong><br />
  Opt for a cream furniture paint that is specifically designed for outdoor use. This type of paint is formulated to withstand various weather conditions, including rain, sunlight, and UV rays.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Tip 2: Prepare your furniture properly:</strong><br />
  Before painting, thoroughly clean your garden furniture to remove any dirt, dust, or grease. Lightly sand the surface to ensure better paint adhesion. If your furniture has any loose or flaking paint, be sure to scrape it off before painting.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Tip 3: Apply multiple coats:</strong><br />
  For best results, apply at least two coats of cream furniture paint. Allow each coat to dry completely before applying the next one. This will help to ensure a smooth, even finish and provide adequate protection for your furniture.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Tip 4: Protect your painted furniture:</strong><br />
  To protect your painted garden furniture from the elements, consider applying a clear sealant or varnish. This will help to防水and protect the paint from fading or chipping. You should also store your furniture indoors or cover it during harsh weather conditions.
