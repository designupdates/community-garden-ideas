  Answer 2: To choose durable and long-lasting garden furniture, look for pieces that are made from high-quality materials and construction. Metal furniture, such as aluminum or wrought iron, is generally very durable and can withstand harsh weather conditions. Teak wood is also a good choice for outdoor furniture, as it is naturally resistant to rot and decay.

</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Question 5: How can I clean and maintain my garden furniture?</em></strong><br />
