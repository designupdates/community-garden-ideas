</p>
<p>
  While barbell furniture is often associated with a masculine aesthetic, it can also be incorporated into more eclectic or feminine spaces to create a unique and unexpected contrast. The key is to balance the bold lines of the furniture with softer elements, such as plush cushions, warm textiles, and colorful accessories.
