  <strong>Tip 3: Create a Cohesive Look with Accessories:</strong> Accessories can help tie your garden furniture together and create a cohesive look. Consider adding outdoor rugs, throws, and decorative pillows to add warmth and texture to your space. You can also incorporate potted plants and flowers to bring a touch of nature into your outdoor oasis.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Tip 4: Maintain Your Garden Furniture:</strong> To keep your garden furniture looking its best and extend its lifespan, regular maintenance is key. Clean your furniture regularly with mild soap and water, and apply protective coatings or sealants as recommended by the manufacturer. Store cushions and other accessories in a dry place when not in use to protect them from the elements.
</p>
