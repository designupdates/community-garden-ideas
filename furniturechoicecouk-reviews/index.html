<p>
  <strong><em>Question 1: What materials are commonly used for garden furniture?</em></strong><br />
  Answer 1: Garden furniture is typically made from materials like wood, metal, plastic, and rattan. Wood offers a classic and natural look, while metal is durable and low-maintenance. Plastic is a budget-friendly and weather-resistant option, and rattan provides a touch of elegance.

<p>
  <strong><em>Question 2: How do I choose garden furniture that suits my needs?</em></strong><br />
  Answer 2: Consider the size of your garden, the purpose of the furniture (dining, lounging, etc.), and your personal style preferences. Measure the space where you plan to place the furniture to ensure it fits comfortably.
