<p>
  <strong>Tip 3: Pay attention to comfort:</strong> You'll be spending a lot of time relaxing in your garden furniture, so make sure it's comfortable. Choose chairs and sofas with cushions that provide good support and lumbar support. You may also want to consider adding outdoor cushions and throws for extra comfort.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Tip 4: Protect your furniture:</strong> To keep your garden furniture looking its best and lasting for years to come, protect it from harsh weather conditions. Use covers or store your furniture indoors during the off-season. You can also apply protective finishes or sealants to wood or metal furniture to prevent fading and rust.
</p>
