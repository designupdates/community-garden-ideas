  <strong>1. Choose the right paint.</strong> Not all paints are created equal. When choosing a paint for your garden furniture, it is important to select a paint that is specifically designed for outdoor use. Outdoor paints are more durable and resistant to fading and peeling than indoor paints.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>2. Prepare your furniture properly.</strong> Before you start painting, it is important to prepare your garden furniture properly. This includes cleaning the furniture thoroughly to remove any dirt or debris, sanding the surface of the furniture lightly to create a smooth surface for the paint to adhere to, and priming the furniture with a coat of primer.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>3. Apply thin coats of paint.</strong> When painting your garden furniture, it is best to apply thin coats of paint rather than thick coats. This will help to prevent the paint from running or dripping.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>4. Allow each coat to dry completely.</strong> Before applying the next coat of paint, allow each coat to dry completely. This will usually take several hours, depending on the temperature and humidity.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>5. Protect your painted furniture.</strong> Once you have finished painting your garden furniture, it is important to protect it from the elements. You can do this by applying a clear coat of sealer to the furniture. This will help to protect the paint from fading and peeling.
</p>
<p>
  By following these tips, you can ensure that your painted garden furniture will look its best for years to come.
