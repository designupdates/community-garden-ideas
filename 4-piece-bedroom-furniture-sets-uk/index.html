    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Complementary Styles:</strong><br />

      The furniture pieces in a cohesive bedroom set should complement each other in terms of style.

    <strong>Balanced Proportions:</strong><br />
    <p>
      The size and proportions of the furniture pieces should be balanced to create a harmonious layout. Ensure that the bed is the focal point of the room, with the wardrobe, dresser, and bedside table arranged in a way that complements its size and style.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Functional Storage Solutions:</strong><br />
    <p>
      A cohesive bedroom furniture set should offer ample storage solutions to keep the room tidy and organized. Look for pieces that incorporate drawers, shelves, and compartments to maximize storage space. This will help maintain a serene and clutter-free environment.
    </p>
