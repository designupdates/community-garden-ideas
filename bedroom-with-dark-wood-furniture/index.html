  For general lighting, you'll want to choose a light fixture that provides enough light to illuminate the entire room. This could be a chandelier, a ceiling fan with lights, or a combination of recessed lighting and table lamps.
</p>
<p>

    <strong>Choose accessories that complement the style of your bedroom.</strong> For example, if you have a traditional bedroom, you might want to choose accessories with a classic or antique look. If you have a more modern bedroom, you might want to choose accessories with a more contemporary look.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Use accessories to add pops of color.</strong> Dark wood furniture can be paired with a variety of colors, so don't be afraid to experiment. You could add a splash of color with a throw blanket, a rug, or some artwork.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Use accessories to add texture.</strong> Texture can help to add interest and depth to a room. You could add texture with a faux fur throw, a knitted blanket, or a woven rug.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Don't overcrowd the space.</strong> A few well-chosen accessories can make a big impact. Don't try to fill every nook and cranny with accessories.
