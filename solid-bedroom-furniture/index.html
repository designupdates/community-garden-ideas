  Solid wood furniture is also more resistant to scratches and dents than furniture made from other materials. This is because solid wood is a harder material than plywood or MDF. Scratches and dents are less likely to show on solid wood furniture, and they can be easily repaired if they do occur.

  Another advantage of solid wood furniture is that it is less likely to wobble or creak than furniture made from other materials. This is because solid wood is a more stable material than plywood or MDF. Solid wood furniture is also less likely to sag over time.
