</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Question 1: What is the best material for garden furniture?</em></strong><br />
  Answer: The best material for garden furniture depends on your individual needs and preferences. Some popular materials include teak, metal (such as aluminum or wrought iron), and wicker. Teak is a durable and weather-resistant wood that is naturally resistant to rot and decay. Metal furniture is also durable and weather-resistant, but it can get hot in the sun. Wicker furniture is lightweight and easy to move, but it is not as durable as teak or metal.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Question 2: How do I choose the right size garden furniture?</em></strong><br />
  Answer: When choosing garden furniture, it is important to consider the size of your outdoor space and the number of people you typically entertain.

If you have a larger space, you can choose larger pieces of furniture that will provide more seating and comfort.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Question 3: What is the best way to care for garden furniture?</em></strong><br />
  Answer: The best way to care for garden furniture is to clean it regularly with a mild soap and water solution.

If you live in a climate with harsh winters, you should store your garden furniture indoors during the winter months.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Question 4: How can I make my garden furniture more comfortable?</em></strong><br />
  Answer: There are a few things you can do to make your garden furniture more comfortable. You can add cushions and pillows to your chairs and sofas.
