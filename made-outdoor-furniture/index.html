</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Durable woods:</strong> Woods like teak, cedar, and eucalyptus are naturally resistant to rot, decay, and insects. They can withstand sun exposure and moisture, making them ideal for outdoor furniture.
  </li>

<p>
  <strong>Details:</strong> These woods have a natural protective oil that repels water and prevents cracking. They also have tight grain patterns that minimize moisture absorption.
</p><strong>Powder-coated metals:</strong> Powder-coated metals, such as aluminum and steel, are treated with a protective layer that resists rust and corrosion. They can withstand extreme temperatures and harsh weather conditions.
<p>
  <strong>Details:</strong> The powder coating process involves applying a dry powder to the metal surface and then curing it under heat. This creates a durable and weather-resistant finish.
</p><strong>Synthetic materials:</strong> Synthetic materials like polyethylene and polypropylene are UV-resistant and can withstand fading and cracking caused by prolonged sun exposure. They are also resistant to moisture and extreme temperatures.
<p>
  <strong>Details:</strong> These materials are often used to create outdoor furniture pieces such as Adirondack chairs, chaise lounges, and patio tables. They are lightweight, easy to clean, and require minimal maintenance.
</p><strong>All-weather fabrics:</strong> All-weather fabrics are designed to withstand outdoor conditions, including sun exposure, rain, and mildew. They are typically made from synthetic materials like polyester or acrylic, which are quick-drying and resistant to fading.
<p>
  <strong>Details:</strong> All-weather fabrics are often used for cushions, pillows, and umbrellas. They are also available in a wide range of colors and patterns to complement any outdoor decor.

  <strong>Details:</strong> Materials like powder-coated metals, synthetic woods, and all-weather fabrics are easy to wipe clean. Simply use a soft cloth and a mild detergent, and rinse with water.
</p><strong>Removable cushions and covers:</strong> Many made outdoor furniture pieces come with removable cushions and covers. This makes it easy to clean or replace them if they become dirty or damaged.
<p>
  <strong>Details:</strong> Removable cushions and covers can be machine-washed or hand-washed, depending on the manufacturer's instructions. This makes it easy to keep them looking fresh and new.
</p><strong>Rust-resistant materials:</strong> Made outdoor furniture made from rust-resistant materials, such as powder-coated metals and synthetic woods, requires minimal maintenance. These materials do not rust, so you don't have to worry about applying protective coatings or dealing with rust stains.
<p>
  <strong>Details:</strong> Rust-resistant materials are ideal for outdoor furniture that is exposed to rain or moisture. They are also easy to clean and maintain.
</p><strong>Fade-resistant materials:</strong> Made outdoor furniture made from fade-resistant materials, such as all-weather fabrics and UV-resistant plastics, can withstand prolonged sun exposure without fading or losing their color. This means you can enjoy your furniture for years to come without worrying about it fading.
