This information can be helpful for identifying the specific piece of furniture that you have and for learning more about its history.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Style information</strong><br />
    <p>
      Heywood-Wakefield furniture was made in a variety of different styles, including Mission, Arts and Crafts, and Art Deco. The style of your furniture can be identified by its overall design, as well as by the details of its construction. For example, Mission furniture is typically made of oak or other dark woods and features simple, straight lines.

    </p>
  </li>
</ul>If the label on your Heywood-Wakefield furniture includes style and model information, you can use this information to learn more about the history of your piece and to identify its specific design.
<h3>
  Can help determine furniture's age and origin
</h3>
<p>
  The information found on a furniture label can help you to determine your furniture's age and origin. The company name, city and state of manufacture, date code, style information, and model number can all be used to narrow down the possible dates and locations of your furniture's production.
</p>
<p>
  For example, if your furniture's label indicates that it was made by the "Heywood-Wakefield Company" in "Gardner, Massachusetts" and has a date code of "23K", you can conclude that your furniture was made in November of 1923 in Gardner, Massachusetts.
</p>

You can use the information on the label to search for information about the company that made your furniture, the style of your furniture, and the history of your furniture's original location. This information can help you to learn more about your furniture's value and to appreciate its unique history.
