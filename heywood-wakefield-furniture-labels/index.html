This can be helpful for dating your piece and for learning more about its history.
<h3>
  May provide style and model information

<p>
  In addition to the company name, city and state of manufacture, and date code, some Heywood-Wakefield furniture labels also include information about the furniture's style and model number. This information can be helpful for identifying the specific piece of furniture that you have and for learning more about its history.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Style information</strong><br />
    <p>
      Heywood-Wakefield furniture was made in a variety of different styles, including Mission, Arts and Crafts, and Art Deco. The style of your furniture can be identified by its overall design, as well as by the details of its construction. For example, Mission furniture is typically made of oak or other dark woods and features simple, straight lines. Arts and Crafts furniture is often made of lighter woods and features more elaborate carvings and decoration. Art Deco furniture is characterized by its sleek, geometric lines and its use of exotic materials, such as chrome and Bakelite.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Model number</strong><br />
    <p>
      Heywood-Wakefield furniture was also assigned model numbers. The model number can be found on the furniture's label, as well as on the bottom of the piece itself. The model number can be used to identify the specific piece of furniture that you have and to learn more about its history. For example, you can use the model number to find out when the piece was made, what materials were used to make it, and what its original price was.
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>If the label on your Heywood-Wakefield furniture includes style and model information, you can use this information to learn more about the history of your piece and to identify its specific design.
<h3>
  Can help determine furniture's age and origin
</h3>
<p>
  The information found on a furniture label can help you to determine your furniture's age and origin. The company name, city and state of manufacture, date code, style information, and model number can all be used to narrow down the possible dates and locations of your furniture's production.
</p>
<p>
  For example, if your furniture's label indicates that it was made by the "Heywood-Wakefield Company" in "Gardner, Massachusetts" and has a date code of "23K", you can conclude that your furniture was made in November of 1923 in Gardner, Massachusetts.
</p>
<p>
  Once you have determined your furniture's age and origin, you can begin to research its history. You can use the information on the label to search for information about the company that made your furniture, the style of your furniture, and the history of your furniture's original location. This information can help you to learn more about your furniture's value and to appreciate its unique history.
