  Old garden furniture can be a beautiful and valuable addition to your outdoor space, but it can also be fragile and in need of some TLC. If you're lucky enough to have some old garden furniture that you want to restore, there are a few things you can do to bring it back to its former glory.
</p>
<p>
  First, you'll need to assess the condition of the furniture. Is it made of wood, metal, or plastic? Is it rusty, cracked, or peeling? Once you know what you're dealing with, you can start to gather the materials you'll need to restore it.
</p>
<p>
  If the furniture is made of wood, you'll need to clean it with a mild soap and water solution. Once it's dry, you can sand it down to remove any rough spots or splinters. If the wood is cracked, you can repair it with wood glue or epoxy. Once the wood is repaired, you can apply a new coat of paint or stain to protect it from the elements.

</p>
<p>
  By following these steps, you can clean and sand your old garden furniture and prepare it for a new finish.
</p>
