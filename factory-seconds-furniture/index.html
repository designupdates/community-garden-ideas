<h3>
  Require special care
</h3>
<p>

</p>
<ul>

  <li>
    <strong>Be careful with spills</strong>: If you spill something on your factory seconds furniture, be sure to clean it up immediately. Spills can stain the furniture and cause damage. To clean up a spill, blot it with a clean cloth. Do not rub, as this can spread the spill and make it worse.
  </li>
  <li>

</p>
<h3>
  Can increase in value
</h3>
<p>
  While factory seconds furniture is typically sold at a discount, it's important to note that these pieces can actually increase in value over time. This is because factory seconds furniture is often made from the same high-quality materials as non-defective furniture. The only difference is the minor cosmetic flaws. As these flaws become less noticeable over time, the value of the furniture can increase.
</p>
<p>
  In addition, factory seconds furniture can become more valuable if it is from a discontinued line. This is because these pieces are no longer being produced, which makes them more rare and desirable. As a result, discontinued factory seconds furniture can sell for a higher price than non-defective furniture from the same line.
</p>
<p>
  Of course, not all factory seconds furniture will increase in value. The value of the furniture will depend on a number of factors, including the quality of the materials, the severity of the cosmetic flaws, and the age of the piece. However, if you find a well-made factory seconds piece from a discontinued line, it's possible that the value of the piece will increase over time.
</p>
<p>
  Overall, factory seconds furniture is a great way to save money on your furniture purchases. And, with proper care, these pieces can last for many years to come. So, if you're looking for a way to add style and value to your home, be sure to consider factory seconds furniture.
