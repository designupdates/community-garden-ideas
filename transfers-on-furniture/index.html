    <strong>Use thick and durable materials</strong><br />
    <p>
      Transfers are made from a variety of materials, including plastic, fabric, and leather. When choosing a transfer, it's important to select one that is made from a thick and durable material that will be able to withstand scratches.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Choose a transfer that fits snugly</strong><br />

</p>
<p>
  Transfers can help to prevent dents by providing a layer of protection between the furniture's surface and the object that is causing the impact. This layer of protection can help to absorb the impact and prevent the dent from forming.
</p>
<p>
  When choosing a transfer to prevent dents, it is important to select one that is made from a durable material that is thick enough to withstand impacts. It is also important to choose a transfer that fits snugly over the furniture's surface.

</h3>
<p>
  Dust is a major problem for furniture, as it can cause the furniture to become dull and faded. Dust can also contain allergens, which can trigger allergies and asthma.
