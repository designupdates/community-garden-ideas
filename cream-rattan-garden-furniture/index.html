</p>
<p>
  When choosing garden furniture, it's important to consider the size of your outdoor space. Choose pieces that are appropriately sized and won't overcrowd the area. For example, if you have a small patio, opt for a compact bistro set or a few foldable chairs.

  One of the best ways to make the most of your garden space is to create different zones for different activities. For example, you could create a dining area, a lounge area, and a relaxation area. Arrange your furniture accordingly, leaving enough space for people to move around comfortably.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Tip 3: Add cushions and throws for comfort and style.</em></strong>
</p>
<p>
  Cushions and throws can make your garden furniture more comfortable and inviting. Choose cushions and throws that are weather-resistant and made from durable fabrics. You can also use cushions and throws to add a pop of color and personality to your outdoor space.
</p>
<p>
