  <strong><em>Question 2: How do I choose the right size garden furniture?</em></strong><br />
  Answer: When choosing the right size garden furniture, it's important to consider the available space and the number of people you want to accommodate. Measure the area where you plan to place the furniture and choose pieces that fit comfortably without overcrowding the space.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Question 3: What style of garden furniture is right for me?</em></strong><br />
  Answer: The style of garden furniture you choose should complement your outdoor décor and personal taste. Consider the overall aesthetic of your garden and choose pieces that match or enhance the existing style.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Question 4: How do I maintain my garden furniture?</em></strong><br />
  Answer: Regular maintenance is key to keeping your garden furniture looking its best. Clean the furniture regularly with a mild soap solution and water. For wooden furniture, apply a protective sealant or oil to prevent fading and weathering.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Question 5: How do I store garden furniture during the winter?</em></strong><br />
  Answer: If possible, store your garden furniture indoors during the winter months to protect it from harsh weather conditions. If indoor storage is not an option, cover the furniture with waterproof covers to keep it dry and protected.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Question 6: Can I leave garden furniture outside all year round?</em></strong><br />
  Answer: Some garden furniture is designed to withstand year-round outdoor use, while others may require more protection from the elements. Check the manufacturer's recommendations for the specific furniture you purchase.
