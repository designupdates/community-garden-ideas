<h3>
  Make use of cardboard boxes
</h3>
<p>
  Cardboard boxes are a great way to provide your cat with affordable and fun furniture. Cats love to play in and hide in boxes, so you can easily turn a few cardboard boxes into a cat castle or playhouse.
</p>
<p>
  To make a cardboard box cat castle, simply cut out a few holes in the sides of the boxes and stack them on top of each other. You can also add some tunnels or ramps to connect the boxes.
</p>
<p>
  To make a cardboard box cat playhouse, cut out a few windows and a door in the sides of the box. You can also add some toys or treats inside the box to make it more fun for your cat.
</p>
<p>
  Cardboard boxes are also great for making scratching posts. Simply cover a cardboard box with carpet or sisal rope and your cat will have a place to scratch that won't damage your furniture.
</p>

</p>
<ul>
  <li>Choose sturdy cardboard boxes that are large enough for your cat to fit in.
  </li>
  <li>Cut out the holes and windows carefully to avoid sharp edges.
  </li>
  <li>Add some toys or treats to the boxes to make them more fun for your cat.
  </li>
  <li>Supervise your cat when they are playing with cardboard boxes, especially if they are kittens.
  </li>
</ul>
<h3>
  Utilize vertical space with cat trees
</h3>
<p>
  Cat trees are a great way to provide your cat with a place to climb, scratch, and play without taking up too much floor space. Cat trees come in a variety of sizes and styles, so you can find one that fits your home and your cat's needs.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Save space:</strong> Cat trees are a great way to save space in your home. They can be placed in a corner or against a wall, so they won't take up much floor space.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Provide exercise:</strong> Cat trees give your cat a place to climb and play, which is important for their physical and mental health.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Satisfy scratching needs:</strong> Cat trees often have scratching posts built in, so your cat can satisfy their natural scratching needs without damaging your furniture.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Provide a safe place to hide:</strong> Cat trees can provide your cat with a safe place to hide and sleep, which is especially important for shy or anxious cats.

<h3>
  Prioritize functionality over aesthetics
</h3>
<p>
  When choosing cat furniture, it's important to prioritize functionality over aesthetics. This means choosing furniture that is comfortable, safe, and durable, even if it's not the most stylish piece in the room.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Comfort:</strong> Your cat's comfort should be your top priority when choosing cat furniture. Choose furniture that is soft, supportive, and provides a comfortable place for your cat to sleep and relax.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Safety:</strong> Cat furniture should be safe for your cat to use. Avoid furniture with sharp edges or small parts that could be a choking hazard. Choose furniture that is sturdy and well-made, so it won't collapse or tip over.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Durability:</strong> Cat furniture should be durable enough to withstand your cat's claws and teeth. Choose furniture that is made from high-quality materials that will last for years.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Easy to clean:</strong> Cat furniture should be easy to clean. Choose furniture that can be wiped down with a damp cloth or machine-washed.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  By prioritizing functionality over aesthetics, you can choose cat furniture that will provide your cat with years of comfort and enjoyment.
</p>
<h3>
  Choose durable materials for longevity
</h3>
<p>
  When choosing cat furniture, it's important to choose furniture that is made from durable materials that will last for years. This will save you money in the long run, as you won't have to replace the furniture as often.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Wood:</strong> Wood is a durable material that is often used to make cat furniture. Wood furniture is sturdy and can withstand your cat's claws and teeth. It is also easy to clean and maintain.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Metal:</strong> Metal is another durable material that is often used to make cat furniture. Metal furniture is strong and sturdy, and it is also easy to clean. However, metal furniture can be more expensive than wood furniture.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Plastic:</strong> Plastic is a less durable material than wood or metal, but it is also less expensive. Plastic furniture is lightweight and easy to clean, but it can be scratched or damaged by your cat's claws.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Fabric:</strong> Fabric is a soft and comfortable material that is often used to make cat beds and cushions. However, fabric can be easily scratched or torn by your cat's claws. It is also important to choose a fabric that is easy to clean.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
