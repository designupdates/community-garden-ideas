  Metal and wood furniture is renowned for its exceptional durability and longevity. The inherent strength of metal provides a sturdy framework that can withstand heavy use and the rigors of everyday life. Wood, when properly treated and maintained, is also highly durable and resistant to wear and tear.
</p>

  Metal surfaces can be simply wiped down with a damp cloth to remove dust and dirt. For tougher stains, a mild detergent solution can be used. Metal's non-porous nature prevents the absorption of liquids, making it resistant to spills and stains.
</p>
<p>
  Wood surfaces require slightly more care, but they are still relatively easy to maintain. Regular dusting and occasional wiping with a slightly damp cloth will keep wood looking its best. For deeper cleaning, wood cleaners specifically designed for the type of wood finish can be used.
