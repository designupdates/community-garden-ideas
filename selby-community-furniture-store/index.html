  Environmental benefits of reusing furniture
</h3>
<p>
  The Selby Community Furniture Store helps to reduce the amount of furniture that is sent to landfill. This has a number of environmental benefits.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Reduced greenhouse gas emissions:</strong> When furniture is sent to landfill, it decomposes and releases methane gas. Methane is a greenhouse gas that is 25 times more potent than carbon dioxide. By reusing furniture, the Selby Community Furniture Store helps to reduce the amount of methane gas that is released into the atmosphere.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Reduced air and water pollution:</strong> When furniture is manufactured, it often releases harmful chemicals into the air and water. By reusing furniture, the Selby Community Furniture Store helps to reduce the amount of air and water pollution that is caused by the manufacture of new furniture.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Reduced deforestation:</strong> When new furniture is manufactured, trees are often cut down to make the wood that is used to make the furniture. By reusing furniture, the Selby Community Furniture Store helps to reduce the demand for new furniture, which in turn helps to reduce deforestation.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Conservation of resources:</strong> When furniture is reused, it conserves valuable resources, such as wood, metal, and plastic. This helps to reduce the need to extract these resources from the Earth, which can have a negative impact on the environment.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  Overall, the Selby Community Furniture Store's work to reuse furniture has a number of positive environmental benefits. The store helps to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, air and water pollution, deforestation, and the conservation of resources.
