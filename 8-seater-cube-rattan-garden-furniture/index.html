<p>
  <strong>Tip 2: Arrange your furniture thoughtfully:</strong><br />
  Arrange your furniture in a way that promotes conversation and allows for easy movement. Create distinct areas for dining, lounging, and entertaining. Leave enough space between furniture pieces to avoid overcrowding.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Tip 3: Accessorize with comfort and style:</strong><br />
  Add comfortable cushions, pillows, and throws to your furniture to make it more inviting. Use an outdoor rug to define the space and create a cozy atmosphere. Incorporate decorative elements such as potted plants, lanterns, and wind chimes to add personality to your outdoor living area.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Tip 4: Keep your furniture clean and well-maintained:</strong><br />
  Regularly clean your garden furniture with mild soap and water. Use a protective sealant or stain to protect the finish. Store cushions and other accessories indoors when not in use. By properly maintaining your furniture, you can extend its lifespan and keep it looking its best.
