<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Neutral Posture:</strong><br />
    <p>
      Ergonomic furniture supports a neutral posture, reducing strain on muscles and joints. Look for chairs with adjustable seat height, backrest, and armrests to allow employees to maintain a comfortable and upright posture.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Proper Back Support:</strong><br />

      Select desks with adjustable heights to accommodate different user preferences and tasks. Adjustable desks allow employees to work in a standing or sitting position, promoting movement and reducing the risk of sedentary behavior.

  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Adequate Legroom:</strong><br />
    <p>
      Ensure sufficient legroom under desks and tables to prevent discomfort and promote proper blood circulation. Adequate legroom allows employees to stretch their legs and maintain a comfortable posture.
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  By implementing these ergonomic design principles, you can create a workspace that prioritizes employee health and well-being, leading to improved productivity and job satisfaction.

    <p>
      Divide the office space into different functional zones, such as individual workspaces, collaboration areas, and meeting rooms. This zoning ensures efficient workflows and minimizes distractions.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Traffic Flow Analysis:</strong><br />
    <p>
      Analyze the flow of movement within the office space. Create clear pathways and avoid congested areas to promote smooth circulation and prevent accidents.

    <p>
      Arrange furniture in a way that supports collaboration and communication. Position desks and chairs to facilitate interaction among employees and create open lines of sight.
