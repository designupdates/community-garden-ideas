    <strong>Consider the cost of delivery:</strong> When comparing prices, be sure to factor in the cost of delivery. Some stores offer free delivery, while others charge a fee.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Don't be afraid to negotiate:</strong> If you're buying your garden furniture from a local store, don't be afraid to negotiate the price. You may be able to get a lower price if you're willing to pay in cash or if you're buying multiple items.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
