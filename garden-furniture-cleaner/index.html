  Material compatibility: Choose a cleaner specifically formulated for the material of your furniture.
</h3>
<p>
  The type of garden furniture cleaner you choose will depend on the material of your furniture. Using the wrong cleaner can damage the finish or cause discoloration. Here are some specific considerations for different materials:
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Wood:</strong> Wood furniture requires a cleaner that is specifically designed for wood. These cleaners typically contain mild detergents and brighteners to remove dirt and grime without damaging the wood's finish. Avoid using harsh cleaners or detergents, as these can strip away the wood's natural oils and cause it to dry out and crack.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Metal:</strong> Metal furniture can be cleaned with a variety of cleaners, but it is important to choose one that is non-abrasive and will not scratch the metal. Dish soap and water is a good option for general cleaning, or you can use a专门清洁金属家具的商业清洁剂. Avoid using harsh cleaners or acids, as these can damage the metal's finish.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Plastic:</strong> Plastic furniture is generally easy to clean and can be cleaned with a mild detergent and water. Avoid using harsh cleaners or solvents, as these can damage the plastic's finish. You can also use a专门清洁塑料家具的商业清洁剂.

</h3>
<p>
  The level of cleaning required will depend on the condition of your garden furniture. If your furniture is only lightly soiled, you may be able to get away with using a mild cleaner. However, if your furniture is heavily soiled or has stubborn stains, you will need a stronger cleaner.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Light cleaning:</strong> For light cleaning, you can use a mild detergent and water. This is a good option for removing dirt and dust from your furniture.
  </li>

    <strong>Medium cleaning:</strong> For medium cleaning, you can use a stronger cleaner, such as a专门清洁花园家具的商业清洁剂. These cleaners are typically more effective at removing dirt and grime.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Heavy cleaning:</strong> For heavy cleaning, you may need to use a专门清洁花园家具的商业清洁剂. These cleaners are typically the most effective at removing stubborn stains and dirt.

    <strong>Stain removal:</strong> If your furniture has stubborn stains, you may need to use a专门清洁花园家具的商业去污剂. These cleaners are specifically formulated to remove stains from garden furniture.
