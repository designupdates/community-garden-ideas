  Material compatibility: Choose a cleaner specifically formulated for the material of your furniture.
</h3>
<p>
  The type of garden furniture cleaner you choose will depend on the material of your furniture. Using the wrong cleaner can damage the finish or cause discoloration. Here are some specific considerations for different materials:
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Wood:</strong> Wood furniture requires a cleaner that is specifically designed for wood. These cleaners typically contain mild detergents and brighteners to remove dirt and grime without damaging the wood's finish. Avoid using harsh cleaners or detergents, as these can strip away the wood's natural oils and cause it to dry out and crack.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Metal:</strong> Metal furniture can be cleaned with a variety of cleaners, but it is important to choose one that is non-abrasive and will not scratch the metal. Dish soap and water is a good option for general cleaning, or you can use aä¸é¨æ¸æ´éå±å®¶å·çåä¸æ¸æ´å. Avoid using harsh cleaners or acids, as these can damage the metal's finish.
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
  <strong>Fabric:</strong> Fabric furniture should be cleaned according to the manufacturer's instructions. Some fabrics can be cleaned with a mild detergent and water, while others require professional cleaning. Avoid using harsh cleaners or solvents, as these can damage the fabric.
</p>
<p>
  By choosing a garden furniture cleaner that is specifically formulated for the material of your furniture, you can ensure that your furniture is cleaned effectively and safely.
</p>
<h3>
  Cleaning power: Consider the level of cleaning required, such as removing dirt, grime, or stains.
</h3>
<p>

</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Light cleaning:</strong> For light cleaning, you can use a mild detergent and water. This is a good option for removing dirt and dust from your furniture.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Medium cleaning:</strong> For medium cleaning, you can use a stronger cleaner, such as aä¸é¨æ¸æ´è±å­å®¶å·çåä¸æ¸æ´å. These cleaners are typically more effective at removing dirt and grime.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Heavy cleaning:</strong> For heavy cleaning, you may need to use aä¸é¨æ¸æ´è±å­å®¶å·çåä¸æ¸æ´å. These cleaners are typically the most effective at removing stubborn stains and dirt.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Stain removal:</strong> If your furniture has stubborn stains, you may need to use aä¸é¨æ¸æ´è±å­å®¶å·çåä¸å»æ±¡å. These cleaners are specifically formulated to remove stains from garden furniture.
