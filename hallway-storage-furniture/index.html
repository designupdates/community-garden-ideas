  <strong>Tip 3: Add Color and Texture with Accessories:</strong><br />

Layer different textures, such as soft blankets, woven baskets, and ceramic pots, to create a cozy and inviting atmosphere. These elements can easily be changed to refresh the look of your outdoor space whenever you desire.

This thoughtful arrangement enhances the functionality of your outdoor space and makes it more enjoyable for various activities.
