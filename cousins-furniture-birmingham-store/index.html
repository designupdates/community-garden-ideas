  When choosing garden furniture, consider the size of your outdoor space and the number of people you typically entertain. You want to choose pieces that are proportional to the size of your space and that allow for comfortable movement. If you have a small space, you may want to choose a bistro set or a few foldable chairs. If you have a larger space, you may want to choose a dining set or a lounge set.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Tip 4: Protect Your Furniture:</strong><br />
  To protect your garden furniture from the elements, you can use a variety of methods. You can apply a sealant or stain to wood furniture to help protect it from moisture and UV rays. You can also use covers to protect your furniture when it is not in use. If you live in an area with harsh winters, you may want to store your furniture indoors during the winter months.
