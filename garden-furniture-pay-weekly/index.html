</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Tip 1: Choose the right material.</em></strong> Garden furniture is made from a variety of materials, each with its own advantages and disadvantages. Wood is a popular choice because it is durable and looks great, but it requires some maintenance. Metal is also durable and easy to care for, but it can be more expensive than wood.

Choose furniture that matches the style of your home and garden. If you have a traditional home, you may want to choose furniture with classic lines and finishes. If you have a contemporary home, you may want to choose furniture with more modern lines and finishes.
</p>

  <strong><em>Tip 3: Make sure it's comfortable.</em></strong> You'll be spending a lot of time sitting or lying in your garden furniture, so make sure it's comfortable. Choose furniture with soft cushions and supportive backs. If you're planning on spending a lot of time entertaining guests, choose furniture that is easy to move around and rearrange.
