<h3>

</h3>
<p>
  Asking about the history of the furniture can help you to learn more about its quality and value. If the furniture is from a reputable manufacturer, it is more likely to be well-made and durable. If the furniture has been owned by a previous owner who took good care of it, it is more likely to be in good condition.

  </li>
  <li>Why is the seller selling the furniture?
  </li>

</p>
<p>
  In some cases, you may be able to find out more about the history of the furniture by doing a little research online.

<h3>
  Negotiate the price. Second hand Chinese furniture can be expensive, so don't be afraid to negotiate the price with the seller.
</h3>
<p>
  Negotiating the price of second hand Chinese furniture can be a daunting task, but it is important to remember that you are in a position of power. The seller wants to sell the furniture, and you are the one who is buying it. This means that you have the upper hand in the negotiation.
</p>
<p>
  Here are some tips for negotiating the price of second hand Chinese furniture:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Do your research.</strong> Before you start negotiating, do some research to find out what the furniture is worth. You can look at online auction sites, such as eBay, to see what similar furniture has sold for. You can also ask a local antique dealer for an appraisal.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Be prepared to walk away.</strong> If the seller is not willing to negotiate, be prepared to walk away. There are plenty of other second hand Chinese furniture stores out there, so you don't have to settle for a price that you're not comfortable with.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Be polite and respectful.</strong> Even though you are negotiating, it is important to be polite and respectful to the seller. Remember, they are trying to sell the furniture, and you are trying to buy it. You're both in this together.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  Once you have done your research and are prepared to negotiate, you can start by making an offer that is below the seller's asking price. Be prepared to negotiate back and forth until you reach a price that you are both happy with.
</p>
<p>
  If you are unable to reach a price that you are happy with, you can always walk away. There are plenty of other second hand Chinese furniture stores out there, so you don't have to settle for a price that you're not comfortable with.
