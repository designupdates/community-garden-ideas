  <strong>Tip 3: Store your furniture properly when not in use.</strong>

<p>
  If you live in an area with harsh winters, it is important to store your garden furniture properly when not in use. This will help to protect it from the elements and prevent damage. You can store your furniture in a garage, shed, or basement. If you do not have a place to store your furniture indoors, you can cover it with a tarp or plastic sheeting.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Tip 4: Recycle or donate your furniture when you are finished with it.</strong>
