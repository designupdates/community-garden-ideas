<h3>
  Size: Make sure the set is the right size for your needs.
</h3>
<p>
  The first thing to consider when choosing a 12 seater rattan garden furniture set is the size. You need to make sure that the set is the right size for your needs. If the set is too small, it will be uncomfortable for your guests. If the set is too large, it will take up too much space in your yard.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Measure your space:</strong> Before you start shopping, measure the space where you want to put the furniture. This will help you determine the maximum size of the set that you can accommodate.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Consider the number of people you will be seating:</strong> A 12 seater set is ideal for large families or for entertaining guests. If you don't need to seat that many people, you can choose a smaller set.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Think about the shape of the set:</strong> The shape of the set will also affect how much space it takes up. A rectangular set will take up more space than a round or oval set.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Consider the size of the cushions:</strong> The size of the cushions will also affect the overall size of the set. If you want comfortable cushions, you will need to choose a set with larger cushions.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  Once you have considered all of these factors, you can start shopping for a 12 seater rattan garden furniture set that is the right size for your needs.
</p>
<h3>
  Shape: Choose a set that has a shape that will work well in your space.
</h3>
<p>
  The shape of your 12 seater rattan garden furniture set will depend on the size and shape of your outdoor space. If you have a small space, you may want to choose a set with a round or oval shape. These shapes will take up less space and will be easier to maneuver around. If you have a larger space, you may want to choose a set with a rectangular shape. Rectangular sets can seat more people and can be arranged in a variety of ways.
</p>
<p>
  Here are some things to consider when choosing the shape of your 12 seater rattan garden furniture set:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>The size of your space:</strong> The size of your space will determine the maximum size and shape of the set that you can accommodate.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>The shape of your space:</strong> The shape of your space will also affect the shape of the set that you choose. For example, if you have a long, narrow space, you may want to choose a rectangular set. If you have a square or round space, you may want to choose a round or oval set.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>The number of people you will be seating:</strong> A 12 seater set is ideal for large families or for entertaining guests. If you don't need to seat that many people, you can choose a smaller set.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>The style of your outdoor space:</strong> The style of your outdoor space will also affect the shape of the set that you choose. For example, if you have a traditional style outdoor space, you may want to choose a set with a more traditional shape. If you have a more modern style outdoor space, you may want to choose a set with a more modern shape.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  Once you have considered all of these factors, you can start shopping for a 12 seater rattan garden furniture set that has the right shape for your space.
</p>
<h3>
  Material: Rattan is a durable and weather-resistant material, but there are different types of rattan.
</h3>
<p>
  Rattan is a natural material that is made from the stems of rattan palms. It is a strong and durable material that is resistant to rot and mildew. Rattan furniture is also relatively easy to care for, making it a good choice for outdoor use.
</p>
<p>
  There are two main types of rattan: natural rattan and synthetic rattan.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Natural rattan</strong> is a natural material that is harvested from rattan palms. It is a strong and durable material that is resistant to rot and mildew. Natural rattan furniture is more expensive than synthetic rattan furniture, but it is also more durable.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Synthetic rattan</strong> is a man-made material that is made from polyethylene. It is a strong and durable material that is resistant to rot and mildew. Synthetic rattan furniture is less expensive than natural rattan furniture, but it is also less durable.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  When choosing a 12 seater rattan garden furniture set, you need to decide which type of rattan is right for you. If you want a set that is durable and will last for many years, you should choose a set made from natural rattan. If you want a set that is less expensive and is still durable, you should choose a set made from synthetic rattan.
</p>
<h3>
  Cushions: Choose cushions that are made from a weather-resistant fabric.
</h3>
<p>
  The cushions on your 12 seater rattan garden furniture set will be exposed to the elements, so it is important to choose cushions that are made from a weather-resistant fabric. Weather-resistant fabrics are designed to resist fading, mildew, and water damage.
</p>
<p>
  Here are some of the most common weather-resistant fabrics used for outdoor cushions:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Polyester:</strong> Polyester is a synthetic fabric that is resistant to fading, mildew, and water damage. It is also relatively inexpensive, making it a good choice for budget-minded shoppers.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Acrylic:</strong> Acrylic is a synthetic fabric that is similar to polyester, but it is more resistant to fading and mildew. It is also more expensive than polyester, but it will last longer.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Sunbrella:</strong> Sunbrella is a brand of acrylic fabric that is specifically designed for outdoor use. It is highly resistant to fading, mildew, and water damage, and it is also very durable.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  When choosing cushions for your 12 seater rattan garden furniture set, be sure to choose cushions that are made from a weather-resistant fabric. This will help to ensure that your cushions will last for many years to come.
</p>
<h3>
  Comfort: Make sure the set is comfortable to sit in.
</h3>
<p>
  One of the most important things to consider when choosing a 12 seater rattan garden furniture set is comfort. You want to choose a set that is comfortable to sit in, even for long periods of time.
</p>
<p>
  Here are some things to consider when evaluating the comfort of a 12 seater rattan garden furniture set:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>The size of the cushions:</strong> The size of the cushions will affect how comfortable the set is to sit in. Make sure that the cushions are large enough to provide adequate support for your back and legs.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>The firmness of the cushions:</strong> The firmness of the cushions is also important. You want to choose cushions that are firm enough to provide support, but not so firm that they are uncomfortable.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>The height of the seat:</strong> The height of the seat will also affect how comfortable the set is to sit in. Make sure that the seat height is comfortable for you and your guests.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>The angle of the back:</strong> The angle of the back will also affect how comfortable the set is to sit in. You want to choose a set with a back that is angled just right so that you can sit comfortably without slouching.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  Once you have considered all of these factors, you can start shopping for a 12 seater rattan garden furniture set that is comfortable to sit in.
