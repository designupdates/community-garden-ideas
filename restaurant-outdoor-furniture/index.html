</p>
<h2>
  Restaurant Outdoor Furniture
</h2>
<p>
  When selecting restaurant outdoor furniture, there are several important points to consider:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Durability:</strong> Choose furniture made from materials that can withstand the elements and heavy use.

Chairs should be high enough to allow customers to sit comfortably at the table, and the depth of the seat should provide adequate leg support. Tables should be the right height for customers to eat and drink comfortably without having to hunch over or stretch too far.
