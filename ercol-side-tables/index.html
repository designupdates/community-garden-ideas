  Handcrafted from solid wood
</h3>
<p>
  Ercol side tables are renowned for their exceptional quality and durability, thanks in large part to the use of solid wood in their construction. Solid wood is a highly sought-after material for furniture due to its inherent strength, resilience, and natural beauty.
</p>
<p>
  Ercol carefully selects the finest solid wood for its side tables, ensuring that each piece is crafted from timber of the highest grade. The wood is then expertly seasoned and kiln-dried to remove excess moisture and prevent warping or cracking over time.
</p>
<p>
  The use of solid wood allows Ercol's craftsmen to create side tables that are both visually stunning and incredibly robust. The natural grain patterns and rich hues of the wood add a touch of organic elegance to any room, while the solid construction ensures that the table can withstand everyday use and maintain its beauty for generations to come.
</p>
<p>
  Furthermore, solid wood is an environmentally friendly choice, as it is a renewable resource that can be sustainably harvested. By using solid wood, Ercol contributes to the preservation of our natural forests and reduces its carbon footprint.

<p>

</p>
<h3>
  Exceptional durability and resilience
</h3>
<p>
  Ercol side tables are built to last, thanks to their exceptional durability and resilience. This is a result of several factors, including the use of solid wood, traditional joinery techniques, and rigorous quality control.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Solid wood construction:</strong><br />
    <p>
      As mentioned earlier, Ercol side tables are crafted from the finest solid wood, which is renowned for its strength and durability. Solid wood is less prone to warping, cracking, and splitting than engineered wood or veneers, ensuring that your Ercol side table will remain sturdy and beautiful for many years to come.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Traditional joinery techniques:</strong><br />
    <p>
      Ercol employs traditional joinery techniques that have been passed down through generations of skilled craftsmen. These techniques, such as mortise and tenon joints and dovetail joints, create strong and durable connections between the different parts of the table, ensuring that it can withstand everyday use and heavy loads.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Rigorous quality control:</strong><br />
    <p>
      Ercol maintains a rigorous quality control process to ensure that each side table meets their exacting standards. Every table is тщательно inspected at various stages of production to identify and correct any defects. This attention to detail ensures that only the highest quality side tables leave the Ercol factory.
    </p>
  </li>

</p>
<h3>
  Natural beauty of wood grains
</h3>
<p>
  Ercol side tables showcase the natural beauty of wood grains, allowing the unique character of each piece to shine through. The skilled craftsmen at Ercol carefully select each piece of wood, ensuring that the grain patterns are both visually stunning and complementary to the overall design of the table.
</p>
<p>
  Wood grains are the result of the way trees grow and adapt to their environment. Each tree has its own unique grain pattern, which is influenced by factors such as the species of tree, the climate in which it grows, and the direction in which it falls. This means that every Ercol side table is one-of-a-kind, with its own distinctive grain pattern that adds to its charm and individuality.
</p>
<p>
  Ercol finishes its side tables with a variety of natural oils and waxes that enhance the beauty of the wood grains while protecting the wood from moisture and wear. These finishes also bring out the natural luster of the wood, creating a warm and inviting look that complements any décor.
</p>
<p>
  The natural beauty of wood grains is a timeless quality that will never go out of style. An Ercol side table with its unique grain patterns will add a touch of elegance and sophistication to any room, while also providing a functional and versatile piece of furniture.
