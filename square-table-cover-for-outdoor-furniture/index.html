  One of the most important benefits of a square table cover is that it protects your furniture from sun damage. The sun's UV rays can cause the fabric of your furniture to fade and crack, and can also damage the finish of your furniture.
</p><strong>Fading:</strong>
<p>
  The sun's UV rays can cause the fabric of your furniture to fade over time. This is especially true for dark-colored fabrics, which absorb more sunlight than light-colored fabrics.
</p><strong>Cracking:</strong>
<p>
  The sun's UV rays can also cause the fabric of your furniture to crack. This is because the UV rays break down the fibers in the fabric, making it more brittle and susceptible to cracking.
</p><strong>Damage to finish:</strong>
<p>
  The sun's UV rays can also damage the finish of your furniture. This is especially true for wood finishes, which can become bleached and faded over time.
</p><strong>Premature aging:</strong>
<p>
  All of these factors can lead to the premature aging of your outdoor furniture. A square table cover can help to protect your furniture from the sun's damaging rays and keep it looking its best for longer.
