<p>
  <strong>Tip 3: Create a Cohesive Look:</strong><br />
  Choose pieces that share similar design elements, such as color, material, or style, to create a cohesive look for your garden furniture. You can also add accessories, such as cushions, throws, and rugs, to tie the look together.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Tip 4: Store Your Furniture Properly:</strong><br />
  During the off-season, store your garden furniture in a dry place, such as a garage or shed. This will help protect it from the elements and extend its lifespan.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Tip 5: Repurpose Old Furniture:</strong><br />
  If you have old furniture that you're no longer using, consider repurposing it for your garden. With a little creativity and effort, you can transform old furniture into unique and stylish garden pieces.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Tip 6: Add Personal Touches:</strong><br />
  Make your garden furniture unique by adding personal touches, such as colorful cushions, patterned throws, or potted plants. This will help create a cozy and inviting atmosphere in your outdoor space.
