</p>

</p>
<h3>

  </li>
</ul>
<h3>

  </li>
</ul>

</p>
<ul>

    <strong>Time limit:</strong> Layaway plans typically have a time limit, such as 30, 60, or 90 days. If you do not pay off the furniture within the time limit, you may lose your deposit and the furniture.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Cancellation fees:</strong> Some layaway plans may charge a cancellation fee if you change your mind and decide not to purchase the furniture.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Storage fees:</strong> Some layaway plans may charge a storage fee if you do not pick up the furniture within a certain amount of time.
  </li>
</ul>
