</p>
<ul>

</p>
<h3>
  No-credit-check financing
</h3>
<p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Easy to apply:</strong> No-credit-check financing applications are typically very easy to complete. You can usually apply online or in-store in just a few minutes.

</p>
<ul>

  </li>
</ul>
<h3>
  Layaway plans
</h3>

  Layaway plans are a great option for people who want to buy furniture but don't have the money to pay for it all at once. Layaway plans allow you to make small payments over time until you have paid off the full price of the furniture. Once you have paid off the furniture, you can take it home.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>

  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Flexible payment options:</strong> Layaway plans typically offer flexible payment options, including weekly, bi-weekly, or monthly payments.
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Secure your purchase:</strong> Layaway plans allow you to secure your purchase and prevent the furniture from being sold to someone else.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>

</p>
<ul>

    <strong>Time limit:</strong> Layaway plans typically have a time limit, such as 30, 60, or 90 days. If you do not pay off the furniture within the time limit, you may lose your deposit and the furniture.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Cancellation fees:</strong> Some layaway plans may charge a cancellation fee if you change your mind and decide not to purchase the furniture.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Storage fees:</strong> Some layaway plans may charge a storage fee if you do not pick up the furniture within a certain amount of time.
  </li>
</ul>
