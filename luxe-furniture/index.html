  <strong><em>Question 1: What are the different types of garden furniture materials?</em></strong><br />
  Answer 1: Garden furniture is typically made from a variety of materials, including wood, metal, plastic, and wicker. Wood is a classic choice for its natural beauty and durability, while metal is known for its strength and resistance to the elements. Plastic is a budget-friendly option that is easy to clean and maintain, and wicker offers a unique and stylish look.

Also, think about the overall design and color scheme of your outdoor area to ensure that the furniture complements your existing décor.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Question 3: How can I protect my garden furniture from the elements?</em></strong><br />
