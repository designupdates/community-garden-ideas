    <strong>Fading.</strong> G Plan furniture is typically made from teak or walnut, which can fade over time. However, excessive fading can be a sign that the furniture has been exposed to too much sunlight or heat.

  <li>
    <strong>Upholstery damage.</strong> If the furniture is upholstered, check for any stains, tears, or rips. Upholstery damage can be difficult to repair, so it's important to factor in the cost of repairs when considering buying a piece of upholstered G Plan furniture.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  Once you've checked for any signs of damage or wear and tear, you can decide whether or not the furniture is right for you. If you're not sure about something, it's always a good idea to get a second opinion from a professional.
