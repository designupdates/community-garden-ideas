</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Question 1: What is the best material for garden furniture?</em></strong><br />

</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Question 2: How do I choose the right size garden furniture?</em></strong><br />
  Answer 2: When choosing the right size garden furniture, it is important to consider the size of your outdoor space and the number of people you typically entertain. You should also consider the size of your furniture in relation to the size of your house and yard.

</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Question 6: Can I leave my garden furniture outside all year round?</em></strong><br />
  Answer 6: Whether or not you can leave your garden furniture outside all year round depends on the material of the furniture and the climate in which you live.
