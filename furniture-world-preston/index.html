  FAQ
</h3>
<p>
  Have questions about garden furniture? We've got answers! Here's a list of frequently asked questions and their responses to help you make informed decisions when choosing the perfect outdoor furniture for your space.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Question 1: What materials are best for garden furniture?</em></strong><br />
  Answer: The best materials for garden furniture are those that can withstand the elements, such as teak, aluminum, and wicker. These materials are durable, weather-resistant, and easy to maintain.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Question 2: How can I protect my garden furniture from the sun?</em></strong><br />
  Answer: To protect your garden furniture from the sun's harmful UV rays, use covers or umbrellas when not in use. You can also apply a protective sealant or stain to the furniture to enhance its resistance to fading and weathering.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Question 3: How do I clean my garden furniture?</em></strong><br />
  Answer: The cleaning method for your garden furniture depends on the material. For teak furniture, use a teak cleaner and sealer. For aluminum furniture, use a mild soap and water solution. For wicker furniture, vacuum or brush away dirt and dust, then wipe down with a damp cloth.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Question 4: Can I leave my garden furniture outside all year round?</em></strong><br />
  Answer: Whether you can leave your garden furniture outside all year round depends on the climate in your area and the materials used to make the furniture. If you live in a climate with extreme weather conditions, it's best to store your furniture indoors or under a protective cover during the off-season.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Question 5: How do I choose the right size garden furniture for my space?</em></strong><br />
  Answer: To choose the right size garden furniture for your space, consider the size of your outdoor area and the number of people you typically entertain. Measure the space where you plan to place the furniture to ensure it fits comfortably.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Question 6: What accessories can I add to my garden furniture?</em></strong><br />
  Answer: To enhance the functionality and style of your garden furniture, consider adding accessories such as cushions, throws, pillows, and outdoor rugs. These accessories can provide comfort, add a touch of color, and define your outdoor living space.
