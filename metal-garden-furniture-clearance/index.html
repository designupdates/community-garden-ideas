  When shopping for metal garden furniture clearance, it's important to carefully inspect the condition of the items before making a purchase. Look for any signs of rust, dents, or scratches.

    <strong>Dents:</strong> Dents can be caused by impact or mishandling. If the dents are small, you may be able to remove them with a rubber mallet. However, if the dents are large or deep, they may not be repairable.
