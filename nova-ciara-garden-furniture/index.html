  Add comfortable cushions and throws to your seating furniture. Consider ergonomic designs and adjustable features for added comfort. Incorporate functional pieces like side tables, ottomans, and storage benches to enhance the functionality of your outdoor space.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Tip 5: Maintain your garden furniture regularly:</strong>

<p>
  Regular cleaning and maintenance will help keep your garden furniture looking its best and extend its lifespan. Use mild soap, water, and a soft cloth to clean your furniture.
