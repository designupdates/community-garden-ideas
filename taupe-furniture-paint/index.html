</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Flat:</strong><br />
    <p>

    <strong>Satin:</strong><br />
    <p>
      Satin paint has a slight sheen that gives it a more polished look than flat paint. It is also more resistant to stains and dirt, making it a good choice for high-traffic areas.

    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Gloss:</strong><br />
    <p>
      Gloss paint has the highest sheen of all the finishes. It creates a very reflective surface that is perfect for making a statement piece of furniture. However, it is also more difficult to apply and maintain, and it can show imperfections in the furniture's surface more easily.
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  The type of finish you choose will depend on your personal preferences and the overall style of your space. If you're not sure which finish to choose, you can always ask for advice at your local paint store.
