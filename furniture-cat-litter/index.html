<h3>
  May reduce litter scatter
</h3>
<p>
  Furniture-style cat litter boxes can also help to reduce litter scatter. Traditional litter boxes often have low sides, which can allow litter to be kicked out of the box when your cat uses it. Furniture-style litter boxes, on the other hand, typically have high sides that help to keep litter contained.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>High sides:</strong> Furniture-style litter boxes typically have high sides that help to keep litter contained. This can be especially helpful for cats who are messy eaters or who like to dig in their litter box.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Enclosed design:</strong> Some furniture-style litter boxes have an enclosed design, which can help to prevent litter from being kicked out of the box. This can be a good option for cats who are particularly messy or who have a habit of kicking litter out of the box.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Large size:</strong> Furniture-style litter boxes are typically larger than traditional litter boxes, which can give your cat more room to move around and do their business. This can help to reduce litter scatter, as your cat is less likely to kick litter out of the box if they have plenty of space to move around.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Non-slip bottom:</strong> Some furniture-style litter boxes have a non-slip bottom, which can help to keep the box in place and prevent it from sliding around on the floor. This can help to reduce litter scatter, as your cat is less likely to kick litter out of the box if it is stable and does not move around.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  If you are looking for a litter box that can help to reduce litter scatter, a furniture-style litter box is a great option. Furniture-style litter boxes are available in a variety of designs and styles, so you can find one that matches your home decor and your cat's needs.
</p>
<h3>
  Can be more expensive than traditional litter boxes
</h3>
<p>
  Furniture-style cat litter boxes are typically more expensive than traditional litter boxes. This is because they are made from higher quality materials and they have a more complex design.

</p>
<ul>
  <li>
