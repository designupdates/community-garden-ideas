  Before purchasing garden furniture, take accurate measurements of your outdoor space to ensure that the furniture you choose fits comfortably and proportionally. Consider the size and layout of your patio, deck, or garden, as well as the intended use of the furniture. This will help you avoid overcrowding or under-furnishing your space.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Tip 3: Consider comfort and style:</strong><br />
  Garden furniture should be both comfortable and stylish to create an inviting outdoor living space. Choose furniture with cushions and padding for added comfort, and consider adding throws and pillows to enhance the coziness factor. When it comes to style, select pieces that complement your home's exterior and your personal taste.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Tip 4: Protect your furniture from the elements:</strong><br />
  To prolong the lifespan of your garden furniture, protect it from the elements. Use weather-resistant covers when the furniture is not in use, and store cushions and other accessories indoors during inclement weather. Regular cleaning and maintenance, such as wiping down surfaces and removing stains promptly, can also help keep your furniture looking its best.
