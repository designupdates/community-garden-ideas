</p>
<p>
  The feet should also be in proportion to the furniture. For example, large feet will look out of place on small furniture. Small feet will look out of place on large furniture.
</p>
<p>
  The color of the feet should also be taken into consideration. The feet should complement the color of the furniture and the overall color scheme of the garden.
