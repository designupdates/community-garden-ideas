  <strong><em>Question 1: How do I choose garden furniture that will last?</em></strong><br />
  Answer 1: When choosing garden furniture, opt for durable materials that can withstand various weather conditions. Look for pieces made of teak, stainless steel, or powder-coated aluminum, as these materials are resistant to rust and decay.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Question 2: What factors should I consider when choosing garden furniture?</em></strong><br />
  Answer 2: Consider the size and layout of your garden, the intended use of the furniture, and the overall style you want to achieve. Measure the available space to ensure the furniture fits comfortably, and choose pieces that suit your needs, whether it's lounging, dining, or entertaining.

  <strong><em>Question 3: How can I make my garden furniture more comfortable?</em></strong><br />
  Answer 3: Add comfortable cushions and pillows to your garden furniture to enhance comfort. Choose weather-resistant fabrics that can withstand outdoor conditions and are easy to clean. You can also add an outdoor rug to define the space and provide a softer surface underfoot.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Question 4: How do I protect my garden furniture from the elements?</em></strong><br />
  Answer 4: To protect your garden furniture from harsh weather conditions, consider using covers or storing it indoors during extreme weather. Regularly clean and maintain your furniture to prevent rust and decay, and apply protective coatings or sealants as recommended by the manufacturer.
