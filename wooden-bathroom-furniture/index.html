<h3>
  Easy to clean and maintain
</h3>
<p>
  Wooden bathroom furniture is easy to clean and maintain. Here are a few tips:

  <li>
    <strong>Dry the furniture thoroughly after cleaning.</strong> This will help to prevent water damage.

    <strong>Apply a furniture polish or wax to the furniture periodically.</strong> This will help to protect the finish of the wood and keep it looking its best.

<h3>
  Good insulator
</h3>
<p>
  Wood is a good insulator, which means that it can help to keep your bathroom warm in the winter and cool in the summer. This can help you to save money on your energy bills.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Wood has a low thermal conductivity.</strong> This means that it does not transfer heat well. This makes it a good insulator.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Wood is a porous material.</strong> This means that it contains a lot of air pockets. Air is a good insulator, so this helps to make wood a good insulator as well.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>The thickness of the wood also affects its insulating properties.</strong> Thicker wood is a better insulator than thinner wood.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>The type of wood also affects its insulating properties.</strong> Some woods, such as oak and mahogany, are better insulators than other woods, such as pine and fir.
