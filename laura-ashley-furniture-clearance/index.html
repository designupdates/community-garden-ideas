  <strong>Answer:</strong> To add style to your garden furniture, choose pieces with unique designs, colors, or textures. You can also incorporate outdoor rugs, throws, and cushions to create a cohesive and stylish look.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Question 5: What are some space-saving garden furniture options?</em></strong><br />
  <strong>Answer:</strong> If you have a small garden, consider folding or stackable furniture, which can be easily stored when not in use. You can also opt for vertical planters and hanging baskets to save space and add greenery to your garden.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Question 6: How can I maintain my garden furniture?</em></strong><br />
  <strong>Answer:</strong> To maintain your garden furniture, clean it regularly with a mild detergent and water.
