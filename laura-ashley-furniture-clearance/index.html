<p>
  <strong><em>Question 5: What are some space-saving garden furniture options?</em></strong><br />
  <strong>Answer:</strong> If you have a small garden, consider folding or stackable furniture, which can be easily stored when not in use. You can also opt for vertical planters and hanging baskets to save space and add greenery to your garden.
