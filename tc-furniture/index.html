  <strong>Tip 3: Pay attention to comfort.</strong> You want your garden furniture to be comfortable to sit in, especially if you'll be spending long hours outdoors. Look for furniture with comfortable cushions and supportive frames.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Tip 4: Don't forget about style.</strong> Your garden furniture should complement the style of your home and outdoor décor. Choose pieces that you love and that make you happy to spend time outdoors.
