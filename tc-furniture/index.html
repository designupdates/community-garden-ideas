  <strong>Tip 1: Consider your needs.</strong> What will you be using your garden furniture for? Dining? Lounging? Entertaining? Once you know what you need your furniture for, you can start to narrow down your choices.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Tip 2: Choose the right materials.</strong> Garden furniture is exposed to the elements, so it's important to choose materials that are durable and weather-resistant. Teak, aluminum, and wicker are all good choices for garden furniture.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Tip 3: Pay attention to comfort.</strong> You want your garden furniture to be comfortable to sit in, especially if you'll be spending long hours outdoors. Look for furniture with comfortable cushions and supportive frames.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Tip 4: Don't forget about style.</strong> Your garden furniture should complement the style of your home and outdoor dÃ©cor. Choose pieces that you love and that make you happy to spend time outdoors.
