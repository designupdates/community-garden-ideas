  FAQ
</h3>
<p>
  Here are some frequently asked questions about garden furniture to help you make informed decisions and keep your outdoor space looking its best:
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Question 1: What materials are commonly used for garden furniture?</em></strong><br />
  Answer 1: Garden furniture is typically made from a variety of materials, including wood, metal, plastic, and wicker. Wood is a classic choice for its natural beauty and durability, while metal offers a modern and sleek look. Plastic is a popular option due to its affordability and low maintenance, and wicker provides a cozy and inviting feel.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Question 2: How do I choose the right garden furniture for my needs?</em></strong><br />
  Answer 2: Consider factors such as the size of your outdoor space, the purpose of the furniture (dining, lounging, entertaining), and your personal style preferences. Measure your space to ensure the furniture fits comfortably, and choose pieces that are functional and aesthetically pleasing.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Question 3: How do I care for wooden garden furniture?</em></strong><br />
  Answer 3: Regular cleaning and maintenance are essential to extend the life of your wooden garden furniture. Clean it with a mild detergent and water, and use a wood protector or sealant to protect it from the elements. Avoid leaving it exposed to harsh weather conditions for extended periods.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Question 4: How do I store garden furniture during the off-season?</em></strong><br />
  Answer 4: Store your garden furniture in a dry and protected area during the off-season to prevent damage from rain, snow, and extreme temperatures. Consider using furniture covers or tarps to keep the furniture clean and dry. Make sure the furniture is completely dry before storing it.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Question 5: Can I paint or stain my garden furniture?</em></strong><br />
  Answer 5: Yes, you can paint or stain your garden furniture to refresh its look or match it with your outdoor décor. Choose a paint or stain specifically designed for outdoor use and follow the manufacturer's instructions carefully. Sand the furniture lightly before painting or staining to ensure better adhesion.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Question 6: How do I clean plastic garden furniture?</em></strong><br />
  Answer 6: Cleaning plastic garden furniture is relatively easy. Use a mild detergent and water, and avoid using harsh chemicals or abrasive materials. Rinse the furniture thoroughly and allow it to dry completely before use. You can also use a plastic furniture cleaner specifically designed to remove dirt and grime.
