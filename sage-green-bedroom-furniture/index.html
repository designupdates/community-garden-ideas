  <li>
    <strong>Biophilic Design:</strong><br />
    <p>
      Incorporating natural accents into your bedroom décor aligns with the principles of biophilic design, which emphasizes the importance of connecting with nature to enhance human well-being. By surrounding yourself with elements of nature, such as wood, stone, and plants, you can create a more inviting and restorative space that supports your physical and mental health.
    </p>

    <p>
      The versatility of sage green also allows you to easily adapt your bedroom décor to different seasons and moods.

    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Reduced Stimulation:</strong><br />
    <p>
      Unlike brighter and more vibrant colors, sage green's subtle hue does not overstimulate the senses.

This is particularly important in the bedroom, where excessive stimulation can interfere with the body's natural sleep-wake cycle.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Connection to Nature:</strong><br />
    <p>
      Sage green's earthy hue reminds us of the serenity of nature, evoking feelings of calm and tranquility.

  <li>
    <strong>Versatile Combinations:</strong><br />
