  <strong>2. Joinery techniques:</strong><br />
  Craftsmen employ traditional joinery techniques, such as mortise and tenon joints, dovetail joints, and dowels, to create sturdy and long-lasting furniture. These techniques ensure that the joints can withstand heavy use and prevent the furniture from becoming wobbly or loose over time.

  Here are a few practical tips for choosing and caring for garden furniture:
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Tip 1: Choose the right material:</strong><br />
  Consider the climate in your area and the intended use of the furniture when choosing a material. Wood is a classic choice for garden furniture, but it requires regular maintenance. Metal furniture is durable and low-maintenance, but it can get hot in the sun. Wicker furniture is lightweight and airy, but it may not be as durable as other materials.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Tip 2: Measure your space:</strong><br />
  Before you purchase garden furniture, measure the space where you plan to put it. Make sure that you leave enough room for people to walk around comfortably and that the furniture is not too crowded.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Tip 3: Choose comfortable furniture:</strong><br />
  You'll be spending a lot of time relaxing in your garden furniture, so it's important to choose pieces that are comfortable. Look for furniture with cushions that are thick and supportive. You may also want to consider adding a few throw pillows for extra comfort.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Tip 4: Protect your furniture from the elements:</strong><br />
  If you live in an area with harsh weather conditions, it's important to protect your garden furniture from the elements. Use covers to protect the furniture from rain, snow, and dust. You can also use sealants to protect the furniture from fading and cracking.
