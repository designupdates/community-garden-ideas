If you have a more traditional nursery, you may want to choose a set with more ornate details. The color of the set is also important. You may want to choose a set that matches the other furniture in the room, or you may want to choose a set that adds a pop of color.
</p>
<p>
  The function of the set is also important to consider. Make sure that the crib is the right size for your baby and that it has all of the safety features that you want. The dresser or changing table should have enough drawers or shelves to store all of your baby's clothes and other belongings. It should also be at a comfortable height for you to use.

<h3>
  Comfortable and safe
</h3>
<p>
  When choosing a 2-piece nursery furniture set, it is important to consider the comfort and safety of your baby. The crib should be a comfortable place for your baby to sleep, and the dresser or changing table should be at a comfortable height for you to use.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Crib mattress</strong><br />
    <p>
      The crib mattress should be firm and supportive, and it should fit snugly in the crib. The mattress should also be made of breathable materials to reduce the risk of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS).
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Crib slats</strong><br />
    <p>
      The crib slats should be spaced no more than 2 3/8 inches apart. This will help to prevent your baby from getting their head or limbs trapped.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Crib height</strong><br />
    <p>
      The crib should be high enough so that you can easily lift your baby in and out, but it should not be so high that you have to strain your back.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Dresser or changing table height</strong><br />
    <p>
      The dresser or changing table should be at a comfortable height for you to use. You should be able to reach all of the drawers or shelves without having to strain or bend over.
    </p>
  </li>

  By considering the comfort and safety of your baby, you can choose a 2-piece nursery furniture set that will provide a safe and comfortable environment for your little one.
</p>
<h3>
  Durable and long-lasting
</h3>
<p>
  When choosing a 2-piece nursery furniture set, it is important to choose pieces that are durable and long-lasting. These pieces will be used on a daily basis, so they need to be able to withstand the wear and tear of everyday use.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Solid wood construction</strong><br />
    <p>
      Furniture made from solid wood is more durable than furniture made from particleboard or MDF. Solid wood furniture is also less likely to warp or crack over time.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Metal hardware</strong><br />
    <p>
      Metal hardware is more durable than plastic hardware. Metal hardware is also less likely to rust or break.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Dovetail joints</strong><br />
    <p>
      Dovetail joints are a type of woodworking joint that is very strong and durable. Dovetail joints are often used in high-quality furniture.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Mortise and tenon joints</strong><br />
    <p>
      Mortise and tenon joints are another type of woodworking joint that is very strong and durable. Mortise and tenon joints are often used in high-quality furniture.

</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Clear instructions</strong><br />
    <p>
      The furniture set should come with clear and easy-to-follow instructions. The instructions should be written in plain English and should include plenty of diagrams.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>All necessary hardware included</strong><br />
    <p>
      The furniture set should include all of the necessary hardware, such as screws, bolts, and nails. You should not have to purchase any additional hardware in order to assemble the furniture.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Pre-drilled holes</strong><br />
    <p>
      The furniture set should have pre-drilled holes for all of the screws and bolts. This will make assembly much easier and faster.
