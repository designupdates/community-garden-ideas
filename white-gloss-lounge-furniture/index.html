Add pops of color through accessories such as cushions, throws, and artwork to add visual interest and personality to the space.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Jewel tones:</strong><br />
    <p>
      If you want to add a touch of luxury and glamour to your living space, incorporate jewel tones such as emerald green, sapphire blue, or ruby red with white gloss lounge furniture. These rich and saturated colors will create a striking contrast against the white gloss finish, making a bold statement in your room. Use jewel-toned accent pieces sparingly to avoid overwhelming the space.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Pastel colors:</strong><br />

      For a soft and romantic look, pair white gloss lounge furniture with pastel colors such as baby pink, mint green, or lavender.

  <strong><em>Question 4: How can I protect my garden furniture from the elements?</em></strong><br />
  Answer 4: To protect your garden furniture from the elements, consider using covers or cushions when not in use.
