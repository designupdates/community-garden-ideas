  FAQ
</h3>
<p>
  Have questions about garden furniture? We've compiled a list of frequently asked questions to help you make informed decisions when choosing and caring for your outdoor furniture.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Question 1: What materials are commonly used for garden furniture?</em></strong><br />
  Answer 1: Garden furniture is typically made from a variety of materials, including wood, metal, plastic, and rattan. Wood is a classic choice for its natural beauty and durability, while metal is known for its strength and resistance to weather. Plastic furniture is lightweight and low-maintenance, and rattan offers a unique and stylish look.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Question 2: How do I choose the right garden furniture for my needs?</em></strong><br />
  Answer 2: Consider the size of your outdoor space, the purpose of the furniture (dining, lounging, entertaining), and your personal style preferences. Measure your space to ensure the furniture fits comfortably, and choose pieces that are functional and aesthetically pleasing.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Question 3: How do I care for my garden furniture?</em></strong><br />
  Answer 3: Regular cleaning and maintenance will help extend the life of your garden furniture. Clean your furniture with a mild detergent and water, and dry it thoroughly. For wooden furniture, apply a protective sealant or oil to prevent cracking and fading. Store cushions and pillows indoors when not in use to protect them from the elements.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Question 4: Can I leave my garden furniture outside all year round?</em></strong><br />
  Answer 4: The durability of your garden furniture will depend on the material and construction. Some materials, such as metal and plastic, are more resistant to weather than others. If you live in a climate with harsh winters, it's best to store your furniture indoors or cover it with protective covers.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Question 5: How do I create a comfortable and inviting outdoor space?</em></strong><br />
  Answer 5: Layer your seating area with cushions, throws, and pillows for added comfort. Add an outdoor rug to define the space and create a cozy atmosphere. Consider incorporating plants and flowers to bring life and color to your outdoor oasis.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Question 6: Where can I find high-quality garden furniture?</em></strong><br />
  Answer 6: Look for reputable garden furniture retailers or manufacturers that offer a wide selection of styles, materials, and price ranges. Read reviews and compare prices to find the best deals. Consider visiting showrooms or outdoor furniture exhibitions to experience the furniture firsthand.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Tip 2: Choose quality materials:</strong><br />

</p>
