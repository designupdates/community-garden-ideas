<h3>
  Insurance: Obtain Adequate Insurance Coverage to Protect Against Loss or Damage
</h3>
<p>
  Securing adequate insurance coverage is essential for protecting valuable assets stored in warehouses. In the event of a loss or damage, insurance can provide financial compensation to cover the costs of repairs, replacements, or business interruption.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Property Insurance</strong>: Obtain comprehensive property insurance to cover the value of the furniture and valuables stored in the warehouse. This insurance should include coverage for fire, theft, vandalism, and other perils.
  </li>
