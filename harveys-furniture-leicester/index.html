  <strong>Tip 3: Create a cohesive design:</strong><br />
  Choose garden furniture that complements the style of your home and garden. Consider the colors, textures, and materials of your existing décor to create a harmonious look. Adding cushions, throws, and other accessories can also help personalize your outdoor space and make it more inviting.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Tip 4: Maintain your garden furniture regularly:</strong><br />
  Regular cleaning and maintenance are essential to keep your garden furniture looking its best and prolong its lifespan. Use mild soap and water to clean the furniture, and avoid harsh chemicals or abrasive materials. For wooden furniture, apply oil or sealant periodically to protect the finish. Additionally, consider using protective covers when the furniture is not in use to shield it from harsh weather conditions.
