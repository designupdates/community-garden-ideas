  </li>
  <li>Monitor placement
  </li>
  <li>Lighting
  </li>
</ul>

  Tips

<p>
  Here are a few tips to help you choose and use garden furniture:
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Tip 1: Choose the right material.</strong> Garden furniture is made from a variety of materials, including wood, metal, plastic, and wicker. Each material has its own advantages and disadvantages. Wood is durable and looks great, but it requires regular maintenance. Metal is also durable, but it can rust if it is not properly cared for. Plastic is lightweight and affordable, but it can fade in the sun. Wicker is a natural material that is both durable and stylish.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Tip 2: Consider your climate.</strong> If you live in a climate with extreme weather conditions, you will need to choose garden furniture that is made from durable materials that can withstand the elements. For example, if you live in a hot and humid climate, you will need to choose furniture that is made from a material that is resistant to fading and mildew.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Tip 3: Choose the right size.</strong> Garden furniture should be the right size for your space. If you have a small garden, you will need to choose furniture that is compact and easy to move around. If you have a large garden, you can choose larger pieces of furniture that will provide more seating and comfort.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Tip 4: Choose comfortable furniture.</strong> Garden furniture should be comfortable to sit on. Look for furniture that has cushions or padding, and that is made from a material that is soft and inviting.
</p>
<p>
  By following these tips, you can choose garden furniture that is stylish, durable, and comfortable.
