  Have questions about garden furniture? We've got answers. Here are some frequently asked questions and their answers:
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Question 1: What is the best material for garden furniture?</em></strong><br />
  Answer: The best material for garden furniture depends on your individual needs and preferences. Some popular materials include teak, wrought iron, aluminum, and plastic. Teak is naturally weather-resistant and durable, making it a good choice for outdoor furniture. Wrought iron is also durable and can be painted to match your décor. Aluminum is lightweight and rust-resistant, making it a good choice for furniture that will be exposed to the elements. Plastic is a budget-friendly option that is available in a variety of colors and styles.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Question 2: How do I choose the right size garden furniture?</em></strong><br />
  Answer: When choosing the right size garden furniture, consider the size of your outdoor space and the number of people you typically entertain. You should also consider the scale of your furniture in relation to the size of your outdoor space. For example, a small patio may be better suited for a bistro set, while a large deck may be able to accommodate a full dining set and a lounge area.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Question 3: How do I care for my garden furniture?</em></strong><br />
  Answer: The best way to care for your garden furniture is to follow the manufacturer's instructions. In general, most garden furniture can be cleaned with a mild soap and water solution. You may also want to apply a sealant or protectant to help protect your furniture from the elements.

<p>
  <strong><em>Question 5: How do I store my garden furniture during the winter?</em></strong><br />
  Answer: If you live in a climate with harsh winters, it is important to store your garden furniture properly to protect it from the elements.
