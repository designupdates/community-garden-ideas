  Before you start shopping for garden furniture, take some time to think about your needs and preferences. What activities will you be using the furniture for?

  Garden furniture should be comfortable to sit in, especially if you plan on spending long periods of time relaxing or entertaining outdoors. Look for furniture with supportive cushions and adjustable features, such as reclining chairs or adjustable table heights.
