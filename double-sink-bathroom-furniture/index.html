<h3>
  Storage
</h3>
<p>
  Double sink bathroom furniture typically has more storage space than single sink bathroom furniture. This is because there are two sinks, which means that there is more space for drawers and cabinets. Double sink bathroom furniture can also have more counter space, which can be used to store toiletries and other bathroom essentials.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Cabinets</strong><br />
    <p>
      Cabinets are a great way to store larger items, such as towels, toiletries, and cleaning supplies. Cabinets can be either open or closed. Open cabinets are more convenient to access, but they can also be more cluttered. Closed cabinets are more private, but they can be more difficult to access.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Drawers</strong><br />
    <p>
      Drawers are a great way to store smaller items, such as makeup, hairbrushes, and toothpaste. Drawers can be either shallow or deep. Shallow drawers are good for storing small items that you use frequently. Deep drawers are good for storing larger items that you do not use as often.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Shelves</strong><br />
    <p>
      Shelves are a great way to store items that you want to keep within reach. Shelves can be either open or closed. Open shelves are more convenient to access, but they can also be more cluttered. Closed shelves are more private, but they can be more difficult to access.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Counter space</strong><br />
    <p>
      Counter space can be used to store a variety of items, such as toiletries, makeup, and hairbrushes. Counter space can also be used to display decorative items, such as plants and candles.
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  When choosing double sink bathroom furniture, it is important to consider the amount of storage space you need. If you have a lot of toiletries and other bathroom essentials, you will need to choose a vanity with plenty of storage space. If you do not have a lot of storage space, you can choose a vanity with less storage space and use other storage solutions, such as baskets and shelves.
