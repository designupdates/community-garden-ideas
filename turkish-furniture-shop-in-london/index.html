  Garden furniture should be comfortable and stylish. Choose pieces that you and your guests will enjoy sitting in. You should also consider the overall style of your garden when choosing furniture. You want the furniture to complement the look and feel of your outdoor space.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Tip 4: Protect your furniture from the elements</em></strong><br />
  Garden furniture is exposed to the elements, so it is important to protect it from the sun, rain, and snow. If possible, cover your furniture when it is not in use. You can also use a sealant to protect the furniture from moisture and UV damage.
