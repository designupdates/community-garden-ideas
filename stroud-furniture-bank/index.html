</p>
<p>
  <strong>Tip 1: Choose furniture that is proportional to your space.</strong>
</p>
<p>
  Oversized furniture can make a small space feel even smaller, while undersized furniture can get lost in a large space. When choosing garden furniture, be sure to take measurements of your outdoor space and choose pieces that are appropriately sized.
</p>

  <strong>Tip 2: Arrange your furniture to create different zones.</strong>

</p>
<p>
  <strong>Tip 3: Add cushions and throws for comfort and style.</strong>
</p>
<p>
  Cushions and throws can make your garden furniture more comfortable and inviting. They can also add a pop of color and personality to your outdoor space. When choosing cushions and throws, be sure to choose weather-resistant fabrics that are easy to clean.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Tip 4: Protect your furniture from the elements.</strong>
</p>
<p>
  Garden furniture is exposed to the elements, so it's important to protect it from rain, sun, and wind. When you're not using your furniture, cover it with a weather-resistant cover. You can also apply a sealant or protectant to your furniture to help it withstand the elements.
