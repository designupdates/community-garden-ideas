  Outdoor rugs can help define your seating area and create a more cohesive look. They also add a touch of comfort underfoot. Consider adding outdoor lighting to extend the usability of your garden furniture into the evening hours. String lights, lanterns, and solar-powered lights can create a warm and inviting ambiance.
