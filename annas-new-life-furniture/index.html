  FAQ
</h3>
<p>
  <strong><em>Have questions about our garden furniture? Here are some frequently asked questions and answers to help you make an informed purchase:</em></strong>
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Question 1: What materials are used to make your garden furniture?</em></strong>
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Answer 1:</strong> Our garden furniture is crafted from a variety of durable and weather-resistant materials, including solid wood, powder-coated aluminum, and weatherproof wicker. These materials are designed to withstand the elements and provide long-lasting beauty and functionality.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Question 2: How do I care for my garden furniture?</em></strong>
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Answer 2:</strong> Caring for your garden furniture is easy. Regular cleaning with mild soap and water will help keep it looking its best. For wooden furniture, applying a sealant or protector can help protect it from the elements and extend its lifespan. Cushions and pillows should be stored indoors or covered when not in use to prevent fading and water damage.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Question 3: Can I leave my garden furniture outdoors year-round?</em></strong>
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Answer 3:</strong> While our garden furniture is designed to withstand outdoor conditions, it's best to bring cushions and pillows indoors during inclement weather or when not in use. Storing furniture in a dry place during the off-season will help protect it from harsh weather and extend its lifespan.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Question 4: How do I choose the right garden furniture for my space?</em></strong>
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Answer 4:</strong> When choosing garden furniture, consider the size and layout of your outdoor space. Choose pieces that are proportional to the area and allow for comfortable movement. Consider the style of your home and garden to ensure the furniture complements your overall aesthetic. Think about the functionality you need, such as seating, dining, or lounging, and choose pieces that meet those needs.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Question 5: Do you offer assembly services?</em></strong>

Consider adding a coffee table or side tables to provide a surface for drinks and snacks.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Tip 3: Add cushions and throws for comfort:</strong>
</p>
<p>
  Cushions and throws can make your garden furniture more comfortable and inviting. Choose cushions and throws that are made from weather-resistant fabrics and are easy to clean. Consider using bright colors and patterns to add a touch of personality to your outdoor space.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Tip 4: Accessorize with plants and lighting:</strong>
</p>
<p>
  Add potted plants and flowers around your garden furniture to create a lush and inviting atmosphere. Plants also help to provide privacy and shade. String lights or lanterns can add a warm and cozy ambiance to your outdoor space, allowing you to enjoy your garden furniture even after dark.
