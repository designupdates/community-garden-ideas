  FAQ
</h3>
<p>
  Have any queries about garden furniture? Here's a helpful FAQ section to address some frequently asked questions. Find answers to common concerns and get the information you need to make informed decisions.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Question 1: What materials are best for garden furniture?</em></strong><br />
  Answer: The best materials for garden furniture are teak, aluminum, and synthetic rattan. Teak is durable, weather-resistant, and naturally water-repellent. Aluminum is lightweight, rust-resistant, and easy to maintain. Synthetic rattan is water-resistant, UV-resistant, and comes in a variety of colors and styles.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Question 2: How do I choose the right size garden furniture?</em></strong><br />
  Answer: Consider the size of your outdoor space and the number of people you need to accommodate. For smaller spaces, choose compact furniture or modular pieces that can be reconfigured. For larger spaces, you can opt for more generous seating and dining sets.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Question 3: How do I care for and maintain my garden furniture?</em></strong><br />
  Answer: Regular cleaning is essential to extend the lifespan of your garden furniture. Use mild soap and water to clean the surfaces. For teak furniture, apply teak oil or sealer to protect it from the elements. Aluminum furniture can be cleaned with a soft brush and soapy water. Synthetic rattan furniture can be wiped down with a damp cloth.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Question 4: How can I protect my garden furniture from the elements?</em></strong><br />
  Answer: Use furniture covers when not in use to shield your furniture from rain, sun, and dust. For added protection, store your furniture indoors during harsh weather conditions, such as Ð·Ð¸Ð¼Ð¾Ð¹ time.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Question 5: Can I leave my garden furniture outside all year round?</em></strong><br />
  Answer: It depends on the materials used. Teak and aluminum furniture can withstand most weather conditions and can be left outdoors all year round. However, synthetic rattan furniture may fade or become brittle if exposed to excessive sunlight or extreme cold for prolonged periods.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Question 6: Where can I buy high-quality garden furniture?</em></strong><br />
  Answer: You can find a wide range of high-quality garden furniture at reputable retailers, both online and in-store. Consider factors such as material, durability, style, and price when making your decision. Read reviews and compare prices to find the best value for your money.
