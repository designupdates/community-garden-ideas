  <strong><em>Question 1: What types of garden furniture are available?</em></strong><br />
  Answer: Garden furniture comes in a wide range of styles, materials, and designs. You can choose from traditional wooden furniture to modern metal and plastic pieces. There are also options for cushioned and non-cushioned furniture, as well as furniture designed for specific purposes, such as dining, lounging, or sunbathing.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Question 2: What materials are used for garden furniture?</em></strong><br />
  Answer: Garden furniture is made from a variety of materials, including wood, metal, plastic, wicker, and rattan. Wood is a classic choice for its durability and natural beauty, while metal is known for its strength and weather resistance. Plastic is a popular option for its affordability and low maintenance, and wicker and rattan offer a natural and stylish look.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Question 3: How do I choose the right garden furniture for my needs?</em></strong><br />
  Answer: When choosing garden furniture, consider the style of your outdoor space, the purpose of the furniture, and the materials that will best suit your climate and lifestyle. It's also important to measure your space to ensure that the furniture you choose will fit comfortably.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Question 4: How do I care for my garden furniture?</em></strong><br />
  Answer: The best way to care for your garden furniture is to follow the manufacturer's instructions. In general, most garden furniture requires regular cleaning and occasional maintenance. Wood furniture should be treated with a sealant to protect it from the elements, while metal furniture should be wiped down with a damp cloth to prevent rust.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Question 5: Can I leave my garden furniture outside all year round?</em></strong><br />
  Answer: Whether or not you can leave your garden furniture outside all year round depends on the materials it is made from and the climate in your area. Some materials, such as metal and plastic, are more weather-resistant than others, and can withstand being left outside in all but the most extreme weather conditions. However, it's generally best to store your garden furniture indoors or under a cover during the winter months to protect it from the elements.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Question 6: Where can I buy garden furniture?</em></strong><br />
