  <strong>Tip 2: Choose the right materials.</strong> Garden furniture is made from a variety of materials, including wood, metal, plastic, and wicker. Each material has its own advantages and disadvantages. Wood is durable and stylish, but it requires regular maintenance. Metal is also durable, but it can be heavy and expensive. Plastic is lightweight and affordable, but it can be less durable than other materials. Wicker is a natural material that is both stylish and comfortable, but it can be more expensive than other materials.

  <strong>Tip 4: Choose the right style.</strong> Garden furniture comes in a variety of styles, from traditional to modern. Choose a style that matches your personal taste and the overall style of your garden.
