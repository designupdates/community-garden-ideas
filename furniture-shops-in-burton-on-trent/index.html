  <strong>Tip 3: Incorporate plants and greenery:</strong>
</p>
<p>
  Surround your garden furniture with plants and greenery to create a lush and inviting atmosphere. Choose plants that are suitable for your climate and require minimal maintenance. Consider adding potted plants, hanging baskets, or vertical gardens to save space.

<p>
  <strong>Tip 4: Create shade and privacy:</strong>
