<h3>
  Protects against moisture
</h3>
<p>
  Teak furniture oil is highly effective in protecting wood from moisture damage. Moisture can cause wood to rot, warp, and crack. Teak furniture oil penetrates deeply into the wood, creating a water-repellent barrier that prevents moisture from penetrating the wood's surface.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Prevents water absorption:</strong> Teak furniture oil fills the pores of the wood, preventing water from being absorbed. This is especially important for outdoor furniture, which is exposed to rain and other moisture.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Prevents swelling and warping:</strong> When wood absorbs moisture, it can swell and warp. Teak furniture oil prevents this by keeping the wood dry.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Prevents rot and decay:</strong> Moisture can cause wood to rot and decay. Teak furniture oil prevents this by creating a barrier that prevents moisture from reaching the wood's interior.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Extends the lifespan of furniture:</strong> By protecting wood from moisture damage, teak furniture oil can extend the lifespan of your furniture.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  If you want to protect your teak furniture from moisture damage, it is important to apply teak furniture oil regularly. This will help to keep your furniture looking its best for years to come.
</p>
<h3>
  Protects against UV rays
</h3>
<p>
  Teak furniture oil also provides protection against UV rays. UV rays can cause wood to fade, discolor, and become brittle. Teak furniture oil contains UV inhibitors that absorb and scatter UV rays, preventing them from damaging the wood.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Prevents fading:</strong> UV rays can cause wood to fade over time. Teak furniture oil prevents this by absorbing UV rays and preventing them from reaching the wood's surface.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Prevents discoloration:</strong> UV rays can also cause wood to discolor. Teak furniture oil prevents this by scattering UV rays and preventing them from damaging the wood's pigments.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Prevents brittleness:</strong> UV rays can cause wood to become brittle and weak. Teak furniture oil prevents this by protecting the wood's lignin, which is a key component of wood's strength.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Extends the lifespan of furniture:</strong> By protecting wood from UV damage, teak furniture oil can extend the lifespan of your furniture.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  If you want to protect your teak furniture from UV damage, it is important to apply teak furniture oil regularly. This will help to keep your furniture looking its best for years to come.
</p>
<h3>
  Protects against environmental damage
</h3>
<p>
  Teak furniture oil also provides protection against environmental damage. Environmental damage can be caused by a variety of factors, including pollution, dirt, and dust. Teak furniture oil creates a barrier on the wood's surface that prevents these contaminants from penetrating the wood.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Prevents pollution damage:</strong> Pollution can damage wood by causing it to discolor, fade, and become brittle. Teak furniture oil prevents this by creating a barrier on the wood's surface that prevents pollutants from penetrating the wood.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Prevents dirt and dust damage:</strong> Dirt and dust can accumulate on wood and cause it to become dull and discolored. Teak furniture oil prevents this by creating a barrier on the wood's surface that prevents dirt and dust from adhering to the wood.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Prevents other environmental damage:</strong> Teak furniture oil can also protect wood from other environmental damage, such as damage caused by insects, birds, and animals.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Extends the lifespan of furniture:</strong> By protecting wood from environmental damage, teak furniture oil can extend the lifespan of your furniture.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  If you want to protect your teak furniture from environmental damage, it is important to apply teak furniture oil regularly. This will help to keep your furniture looking its best for years to come.
