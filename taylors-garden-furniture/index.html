Use mild detergent and warm water to clean the furniture, avoiding harsh chemicals that may damage the materials. For fabric cushions, follow the care instructions provided by the manufacturer. Regularly inspect the furniture for any signs of damage or wear and address them promptly. Store cushions and other accessories in a dry and protected area when not in use.

Furniture made from weather-resistant materials such as teak, aluminum, or synthetic wicker can generally withstand outdoor conditions. However, it's best to protect the furniture with covers or store it in a sheltered area during extreme weather events. Regular cleaning and maintenance are also essential to ensure the furniture remains in good condition.

Incorporate plants and flowers to bring life and color to the space. Consider adding lighting options, such as string lights or lanterns, to create a warm and welcoming ambiance in the evening.
