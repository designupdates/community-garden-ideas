<h3>
  Durable acacia wood
</h3>
<p>
  When it comes to outdoor furniture, durability is key. Jamie Oliver's garden furniture collection features acacia wood, a sustainable and naturally durable hardwood known for its strength and resistance to rot and decay.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Strength and longevity:</strong><br />
    <p>
      Acacia wood is exceptionally strong and durable, making it ideal for outdoor furniture that can withstand the elements and heavy use.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Natural resistance:</strong><br />
    <p>
      Acacia wood possesses natural resistance to rot, decay, and insect infestation, ensuring its longevity and reducing the need for chemical treatments.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Weather-resistant:</strong><br />
    <p>
      Acacia wood's inherent weather resistance makes it suitable for outdoor use, as it can endure exposure to rain, sun, and humidity without warping or cracking.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Beautiful grain patterns:</strong><br />
    <p>
      Acacia wood showcases beautiful and unique grain patterns, adding a touch of natural elegance to your outdoor space.

</p>
<h3>
  Recyclable aluminum frames
</h3>
<p>
  In line with the eco-conscious ethos of the collection, the frames of the furniture are crafted from recyclable aluminum. This choice aligns with the brand's commitment to environmental responsibility and offers several advantages:
</p>
<p>
  <strong>1. Lightweight and durable:</strong> Aluminum is a lightweight material, making it easy to move and rearrange your furniture as desired. Despite its light weight, aluminum is highly durable and can withstand outdoor elements, including strong winds and heavy use.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>2. Rust-free and weather-proof:</strong> Aluminum is naturally rust-free and resistant to weathering, ensuring that your furniture remains in pristine condition for longer. It can withstand rain, sun exposure, and fluctuating temperatures without any signs of deterioration.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>3. Low maintenance:</strong> Aluminum frames require minimal maintenance. You can easily keep them clean by wiping them down with a damp cloth. They do not require painting or staining, further reducing the environmental impact and making upkeep a hassle-free process.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>4. Recyclable and sustainable:</strong> Aluminum is a highly recyclable material. When the furniture eventually reaches the end of its life, it can be responsibly discarded and sent for aluminum recovery. This circular approach minimizes waste and aligns with sustainable practices.
</p>
<p>
  By incorporating recyclable aluminum frames, the collection offers a durable, low-maintenance, and environmentally friendly solution for your outdoor space.

  <li>
    <strong>Teak oil-treated acacia wood:</strong><br />
    <p>

</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Question 2: What are the most durable materials for garden furniture?</em></strong><br />

  <strong>Tip 1: Choose the right location:</strong><br />
  Select a location for your garden furniture that is level, well-drained, and protected from strong winds. Consider the amount of sunlight the area receives throughout the day to ensure that you can enjoy your furniture in both sunny and shady conditions.

  <strong>Tip 2: Arrange your furniture for comfort and functionality:</strong><br />
  Arrange your furniture in a way that promotes conversation and allows for easy movement. Create separate areas for dining, lounging, and entertaining, if space permits. Leave enough space between furniture pieces to avoid overcrowding and to allow for comfortable passage.

  Enhance the comfort of your garden furniture with cushions, throws, and pillows. Choose weather-resistant fabrics and materials that can withstand outdoor conditions. Add outdoor rugs, potted plants, and decorative lighting to create a cozy and inviting atmosphere.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Tip 4: Maintain your garden furniture regularly:</strong><br />
  Regular maintenance is essential to keep your garden furniture looking its best and to extend its lifespan. Clean the furniture periodically with a mild detergent and water. Apply teak oil or other recommended protectants to wooden furniture to preserve its natural beauty and prevent cracking. Store cushions and other accessories in a dry place when not in use.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Tip 5: Accessorize with plants and lighting:</strong><br />
  Incorporate plants and flowers around your garden furniture to create a natural and inviting atmosphere. Add ambient lighting, such as string lights or lanterns, to extend the enjoyment of your outdoor space into the evening hours.
