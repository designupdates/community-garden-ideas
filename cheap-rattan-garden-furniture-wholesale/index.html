  <em>Answer 5: The durability of your garden furniture depends on the materials used and the climate in your area. Some materials, like teak and aluminum, are more resistant to weathering and can withstand being left outdoors year-round. However, it's generally recommended to store cushions and pillows indoors during inclement weather to prevent damage.</em>
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Question 6: How do I protect my garden furniture from harsh weather conditions?</em></strong>
</p>
<p>
  <em>Answer 6: Use furniture covers or tarps to protect your furniture from rain, snow, and dust when not in use. Choose covers made from waterproof and UV-resistant materials for maximum protection. Store cushions and pillows indoors during harsh weather conditions to prevent fading and water damage.</em>
