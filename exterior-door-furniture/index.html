</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <b>The style of your home.</b> The style of your home will help you narrow down your choices for exterior door furniture. If you have a traditional home, you might choose classic hardware like a brass doorknob and deadbolt. If you have a more modern home, you might prefer something more contemporary, like a sleek stainless steel handle and lock.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>The climate in your area.</b> If you live in an area with harsh weather conditions, you'll need to choose exterior door furniture that is durable and can withstand the elements. Rust-resistant materials like stainless steel or aluminum are good choices for areas with rain or snow. For areas with high humidity, brass or copper hardware is a good option because it won't rust or corrode.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>The security of your home.</b> The security of your home should be a top priority when choosing exterior door furniture. Look for hardware that is made from strong materials and that has a deadbolt lock. You should also consider installing a peephole or a doorbell camera to increase the security of your home.
  </li>
</ol>
<p>

    <strong>Add some personality.</strong> You can also add some personality to your home with your exterior door furniture. Choose hardware that reflects your own style, and don't be afraid to experiment with different finishes and styles.

<p>

</p>
<h3>
  Durable
</h3>
<p>
  Exterior door furniture needs to be durable in order to withstand the elements and everyday use. Look for hardware that is made from strong materials, such as stainless steel, aluminum, or brass. These materials are resistant to rust and corrosion, and they will last for many years to come.
</p>
<p>
  In addition to the material, the finish of your exterior door furniture can also affect its durability. A polished finish is more likely to show scratches and wear than a brushed finish. If you are looking for hardware that will last, choose a brushed finish or a finish that is specifically designed to withstand the elements.
</p>
<p>
  Another important factor to consider when choosing durable exterior door furniture is the installation. Make sure that the hardware is installed properly and securely. This will help to prevent it from becoming loose or damaged over time.
</p>
<p>
  By following these tips, you can choose exterior door furniture that is both durable and stylish. This will help to protect your home and add to its curb appeal for many years to come.
</p>
<h3>
  Rust-resistant
</h3>
<p>
  If you live in an area with a lot of rain or snow, you'll need to choose exterior door furniture that is rust-resistant. Rust is a common problem for metal hardware, and it can quickly ruin the appearance of your door.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Choose stainless steel or aluminum hardware.</strong> Stainless steel and aluminum are both rust-resistant materials, making them a good choice for exterior door furniture. These materials are also durable and easy to maintain.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Apply a protective finish.</strong> You can also apply a protective finish to your exterior door furniture to help prevent rust. There are a variety of different finishes available, so be sure to choose one that is specifically designed for use on metal.

  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Inspect your hardware regularly.</strong> It's also important to inspect your exterior door furniture regularly for any signs of rust. If you find any rust, be sure to clean it off immediately. This will help to prevent the rust from spreading and damaging the hardware.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  By following these tips, you can help to keep your exterior door furniture looking its best for many years to come.
</p>
<h3>
  Secure
</h3>
<p>
  The security of your home should be a top priority when choosing exterior door furniture. Look for hardware that is made from strong materials and that has a deadbolt lock. A deadbolt lock is a type of lock that uses a bolt to secure the door in place. This type of lock is much more difficult to break than a regular lock, and it will help to keep your home safe and secure.
</p>
<p>
  In addition to a deadbolt lock, you should also consider installing a peephole or a doorbell camera. A peephole will allow you to see who is at the door before you open it, and a doorbell camera will allow you to see and speak to visitors from anywhere in your home.
</p>
<p>
  Another important security feature to consider is the finish of your exterior door furniture. A polished finish is more likely to show scratches and wear than a brushed finish. If you are looking for hardware that will be more difficult to break, choose a brushed finish or a finish that is specifically designed to resist tampering.
</p>
<p>
  By following these tips, you can choose exterior door furniture that will help to keep your home safe and secure.
</p>
<h3>
  Deadbolt lock
</h3>
<p>
  A deadbolt lock is a type of lock that uses a bolt to secure the door in place. This type of lock is much more difficult to break than a regular lock, and it will help to keep your home safe and secure.
</p>
<p>
  Deadbolt locks are typically installed on the top and bottom of the door. When the lock is engaged, the bolt extends into the door frame and secures the door in place. This makes it very difficult for someone to break into your home by simply kicking in the door.
</p>
<p>
  When choosing a deadbolt lock, it is important to choose one that is made from strong materials and that has a good reputation for security. You should also make sure that the lock is installed properly. A poorly installed deadbolt lock can be easy to break, so it is important to have it installed by a professional.
</p>
<p>
  Deadbolt locks are an important part of home security. By installing a deadbolt lock on your exterior doors, you can help to keep your home safe and secure.
</p>
<h3>
  Peephole
</h3>
<p>
  A peephole is a small hole in a door that allows you to see who is outside without opening the door. This is a great way to improve the security of your home, as it allows you to see who is at the door before you open it.
</p>
<p>
  Peepholes are available in a variety of different styles and finishes, so you can choose one that matches the style of your home. Some peepholes even have built-in features, such as a fisheye lens or a motion sensor.
</p>
<p>
  To install a peephole, you will need to drill a hole in the door. The size of the hole will depend on the size of the peephole that you choose. Once you have drilled the hole, you can insert the peephole and secure it in place.
</p>
<p>
  Peepholes are a simple and effective way to improve the security of your home. By installing a peephole, you can see who is at the door before you open it, which can help to deter crime and keep your family safe.
</p>
<h3>
  Variety of styles
</h3>
<p>
  Exterior door furniture is available in a wide variety of styles, so you're sure to find something that matches the style of your home. If you have a traditional home, you might choose classic hardware like a brass doorknob and deadbolt. If you have a more modern home, you might prefer something more contemporary, like a sleek stainless steel handle and lock.
</p>
<p>
  In addition to the style of your home, you should also consider the finish of your exterior door furniture. The finish can have a big impact on the overall look of your door. A polished finish will give your door a more formal look, while a brushed finish will give it a more casual look.
</p>
<p>
  Once you've considered the style and finish of your exterior door furniture, you can start shopping. There are a number of different places where you can find exterior door furniture, including hardware stores, home improvement stores, and online retailers.
</p>
<p>
