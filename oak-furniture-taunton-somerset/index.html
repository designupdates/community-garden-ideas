<p>
  <strong>Adherence to environmental standards:</strong> Look for retailers that adhere to recognized environmental standards, such as the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) or the Programme for the Endorsement of Forest Certification (PEFC).

</p>
<p>
  <strong>Reduced environmental impact:</strong> Choose retailers that prioritize reducing their environmental impact throughout the manufacturing process. This may include using energy-efficient technologies, minimizing waste, and implementing recycling programs.
