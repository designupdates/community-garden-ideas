<p>
  <strong>Adherence to environmental standards:</strong> Look for retailers that adhere to recognized environmental standards, such as the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) or the Programme for the Endorsement of Forest Certification (PEFC). These standards ensure that the oak used in the furniture comes from well-managed forests and that the manufacturing process meets strict environmental criteria.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Reduced environmental impact:</strong> Choose retailers that prioritize reducing their environmental impact throughout the manufacturing process. This may include using energy-efficient technologies, minimizing waste, and implementing recycling programs.
