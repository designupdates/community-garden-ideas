By reflecting light off of its surfaces, high gloss furniture helps to blur the boundaries of the space, making it feel less cluttered and more expansive. This is especially important in kitchens that are open to other living areas, as it helps to create a cohesive and seamless flow between the spaces.
</p>
<p>
  Furthermore, the reflective surfaces of high gloss kitchen furniture can be used to create interesting visual effects. For example, by placing high gloss furniture opposite a window, you can create the illusion of a larger, more open space.
