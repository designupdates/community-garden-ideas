  FAQ
</h3>
<p>
  Have questions about choosing the perfect garden furniture? Here are some frequently asked questions and answers to help you make an informed decision.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Question 1: What material is best for garden furniture?</em></strong><br />
  Answer 1: The best material for garden furniture depends on your individual needs and preferences. Teak and other hardwoods are naturally durable and weather-resistant, while aluminum and wrought iron are lightweight and rust-resistant. Plastic and resin furniture is affordable and easy to maintain, but may not be as durable as other materials.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Question 2: How do I choose the right size garden furniture?</em></strong><br />
  Answer 2: Consider the size of your outdoor space and the number of people you typically entertain. Measure the available space and choose furniture that is appropriately sized to avoid overcrowding or feeling cramped.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Question 3: What style of garden furniture is most popular?</em></strong><br />
  Answer 3: Modern and contemporary styles are popular choices for garden furniture, with clean lines and simple silhouettes. Traditional styles, such as Victorian and Edwardian, offer a timeless elegance. Ultimately, the best style is one that complements your personal taste and home decor.
</p>
