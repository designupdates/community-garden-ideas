<h3>
  Protect carpet from damage.
</h3>
<p>
  Furniture sliders are designed to protect your carpet from damage caused by moving furniture. When you move furniture without sliders, the legs of the furniture can dig into the carpet fibers and cause permanent damage. Sliders create a smooth surface between the furniture legs and the carpet, allowing you to move furniture easily without damaging the carpet.
</p>
<p>
  Sliders also help to prevent scratches and scuffs on your carpet. When you move furniture without sliders, the legs of the furniture can scrape against the carpet and cause unsightly scratches and scuffs. Sliders create a barrier between the furniture legs and the carpet, preventing scratches and scuffs.
</p>
<p>
  In addition to protecting your carpet from damage, sliders also make it easier to move furniture. When you use sliders, you don't have to lift the furniture off the ground to move it. You can simply slide the furniture across the carpet with minimal effort.
</p>
<p>
  Furniture sliders are an inexpensive and easy way to protect your carpet from damage. They're also easy to use and can be used on all types of furniture.

<h3>
  Use sliders properly.
</h3>
<p>
  To use furniture sliders properly, follow these steps:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Clean the furniture legs:</strong> Before you apply the sliders, clean the furniture legs to remove any dirt or debris. This will help the sliders to adhere to the furniture legs properly.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Place the sliders on the furniture legs:</strong> Place the sliders on the furniture legs, making sure that they are centered on the legs. If you are using multiple sliders per leg, space them evenly.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Press down on the sliders:</strong> Once the sliders are in place, press down on them to make sure that they are securely attached to the furniture legs.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Move the furniture:</strong> Once the sliders are attached, you can move the furniture by sliding it across the carpet. Make sure to lift the furniture slightly off the ground before you move it.

<p>
  Here are some additional tips for using furniture sliders properly:
</p>
<ul>
