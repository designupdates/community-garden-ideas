  Ultimately, the best type of garden furniture fire pit for you depends on your individual needs and preferences. If you're looking for a classic campfire experience, a wood-burning fire pit is a good option. If you're looking for an easy-to-use and maintain fire pit, a gas or electric fire pit is a good choice.
