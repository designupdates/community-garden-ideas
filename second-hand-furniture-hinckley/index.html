  FAQ
</h3>
<p>
  Have questions about garden furniture? We've got you covered. Here are some frequently asked questions and answers to help you make informed decisions when choosing and maintaining your outdoor furniture.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Question 1: What are the different types of garden furniture materials?</em></strong><br />
  Answer 1: Garden furniture comes in a variety of materials, including wood, metal, plastic, and wicker. Wood is classic and durable, but requires regular maintenance. Metal is sturdy and weather-resistant, but can heat up in the sun. Plastic is lightweight and affordable, but may not be as durable as other materials. Wicker is stylish and comfortable, but can be susceptible to moisture damage.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Question 2: How do I choose the right size garden furniture?</em></strong><br />
  Answer 2: Consider the size of your outdoor space and the number of people you typically entertain. Measure the area where you plan to place the furniture to ensure it fits comfortably. Choose pieces that are proportionate to the size of your space to avoid overcrowding or making it feel cramped.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Question 3: How do I care for my garden furniture?</em></strong><br />
  Answer 3: Regular cleaning and maintenance will help extend the lifespan of your garden furniture. Clean the furniture with a mild soap and water solution, and rinse thoroughly. For wooden furniture, apply a sealant or oil to protect it from the elements. Metal furniture can be wiped down with a damp cloth to remove dirt and debris.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Question 4: How can I protect my garden furniture from the elements?</em></strong><br />
  Answer 4: To protect your garden furniture from rain, snow, and sun damage, consider using covers or storing it indoors during inclement weather. Covers are available in a variety of materials, such as canvas, vinyl, and polyester. Choose a cover that is breathable to prevent moisture buildup.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Question 5: Can I paint my garden furniture?</em></strong><br />
  Answer 5: Yes, you can paint garden furniture to change its color or update its style. Choose a paint that is specifically designed for outdoor use and follow the manufacturer's instructions carefully. Sand the furniture lightly before painting to ensure the paint adheres properly.
</p>
<p>
