    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Stone:</strong><br />
    <p>
      Stone, quarried from the depths of the earth, offers a timeless and elegant look to furniture.

  The success of your encrusting endeavors in Dwarf Fortress hinges upon the skill and expertise of your dwarves. Assigning skilled dwarves to encrusting tasks ensures that your furniture is adorned with the utmost care and precision.

  To identify skilled dwarves, observe their attributes and preferences. Dwarves with high attributes in crafting, particularly in metalworking, stoneworking, or bone carving, are well-suited for encrusting tasks. Additionally, dwarves with a passion for art or design often possess the creativity and attention to detail necessary for encrusting furniture with intricate and visually stunning designs.
</p>
<p>
  Once you have identified skilled dwarves, assign them to the appropriate workshops. Make sure that they have access to the necessary materials and tools to perform their tasks efficiently.

Encrusted furniture, due to its high value, is often sought after by traders and can fetch a significant profit.
</p>
