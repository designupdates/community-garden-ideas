    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Stone:</strong><br />
    <p>
      Stone, quarried from the depths of the earth, offers a timeless and elegant look to furniture.

  <strong><em>Tip 1: Arrange for Comfort:</em></strong><br />
  Arrange your garden furniture in a way that promotes comfort and conversation. Create cozy seating areas with chairs and sofas facing each other. Add cushions, throws, and pillows for extra comfort.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Tip 2: Create Zones:</em></strong><br />
  Divide your garden into different zones for various activities. For example, set up a dining area with a table and chairs for meals, a lounge area with comfortable seating for relaxation, and a gardening area with a potting bench and tools.

  Enhance the ambiance of your garden with outdoor lighting. String lights, lanterns, and solar-powered lights can create a warm and inviting atmosphere, allowing you to enjoy your garden even after sunset.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Tip 4: Accessorize Wisely:</em></strong><br />
  Accessorize your garden furniture with outdoor rugs, cushions in vibrant colors, and potted plants. These small touches can add personality and style to your outdoor space.
