  <strong>2. Apply Lancaster cream in a thin, even coat.</strong><br />
  Use a clean, soft cloth to apply the cream to your furniture. Rub the cream into the wood in a circular motion, taking care not to apply too much. Allow the cream to penetrate for a few minutes before buffing it off with a clean cloth.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>3. Reapply Lancaster cream as needed.</strong><br />
  Lancaster cream should be reapplied every 2-3 months, or more often if your furniture is exposed to harsh weather conditions. Reapplying the cream will help to protect your furniture from the elements and keep it looking its best.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>4. Store Lancaster cream in a cool, dry place.</strong><br />
  Lancaster cream should be stored in a cool, dry place when not in use. This will help to extend the shelf life of the cream and prevent it from becoming contaminated.

  By following these tips, you can help to keep your garden furniture looking its best for years to come.
