<p>
  <strong><em>Question 1: How do I choose the right garden furniture?</em></strong><br />
  Answer 1: When choosing garden furniture, consider factors like the size of your space, the purpose of the furniture (dining, lounging, etc.), and your personal style. You'll also want to think about the material the furniture is made from and its durability in different weather conditions.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Question 2: What are the different types of garden furniture materials?</em></strong><br />
