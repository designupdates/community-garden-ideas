    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Sign up for email alerts.</strong><br />
    <p>

    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Ask around.</strong><br />
    <p>
      Talk to your friends, family, and neighbors to see if they know of any good Black Friday deals. You can also check social media and online forums for tips and recommendations.

  In addition to Black Friday sales, many retailers also offer clearance and overstock sales on garden furniture. These items are typically discounted to make room for new inventory. You can often find great deals on clearance and overstock items, especially if you're willing to be flexible with your choices.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Check the clearance section of your favorite stores.</strong><br />
    <p>
      Many retailers have a clearance section where they sell discounted items. This is a great place to find garden furniture that's been marked down for a variety of reasons, such as overstock or discontinued styles.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Shop at outlet stores.</strong><br />
