  The style of your garden furniture should complement the style of your home and garden. If you have a traditional home, you may want to choose classic garden furniture made from wood or metal. If you have a more modern home, you may want to choose contemporary garden furniture made from plastic or aluminum.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Tip 3: Choose the right size.</strong>
</p>
<p>
  The size of your garden furniture should be appropriate for the size of your garden. If you have a small garden, you will want to choose compact garden furniture that does not take up too much space. If you have a large garden, you can choose larger garden furniture that will provide plenty of seating and dining space.
</p>
<p>
