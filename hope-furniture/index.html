<p>
  Have questions about garden furniture? We've compiled a list of frequently asked questions and answers to help you make informed decisions when choosing and caring for your outdoor furniture.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Question 1: What materials are commonly used for garden furniture?</em></strong><br />
  Answer 1: Garden furniture is typically made from a variety of materials, including wood, metal, plastic, and wicker. Wood provides a classic and natural look, while metal is durable and weather-resistant. Plastic is a budget-friendly and low-maintenance option, and wicker offers a bohemian and airy feel.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Question 2: How do I choose the right garden furniture for my needs?</em></strong><br />
  Answer 2: Consider the size and layout of your garden, as well as your personal style and intended use. Choose furniture that is proportionate to the space available and that complements your garden's design. Think about the activities you'll be doing in your garden, such as dining, lounging, or entertaining, and select furniture that suits those purposes.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Question 3: How can I protect my garden furniture from the elements?</em></strong><br />
  Answer 3: To extend the lifespan of your garden furniture, protect it from rain, sun, and harsh weather conditions.

</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Question 5: How can I make my garden furniture more comfortable?</em></strong><br />
  Answer 5: Add cushions, pillows, and throws to your garden furniture to enhance comfort and create a cozy atmosphere. Choose weather-resistant fabrics that are easy to clean and maintain.
