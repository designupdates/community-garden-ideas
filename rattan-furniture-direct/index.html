We use only the innermost core of the rattan pole, which is the strongest and most resilient part of the plant. This ensures that our furniture can withstand the elements and provide years of enjoyment. Unlike other materials such as plastic or metal, rattan is a natural material that breathes. This allows it to regulate temperature, making it comfortable to sit on even in hot or cold weather. Rattan is also resistant to fading and UV damage, so your furniture will retain its beautiful appearance for seasons to come. We are committed to using sustainable and eco-friendly materials in all of our furniture.

Our rattan is treated with a special sealant that protects it from moisture, UV rays, and extreme temperatures. This sealant helps to prevent the rattan from fading, cracking, or warping, ensuring that your furniture will retain its beautiful appearance for seasons to come. The frames of our furniture are made from powder-coated aluminum, which is rust-resistant and incredibly strong. Aluminum is also lightweight, making it easy to move your furniture around as needed. We also use stainless steel hardware on all of our furniture. Stainless steel is corrosion-resistant and will not rust, even in harsh weather conditions.
