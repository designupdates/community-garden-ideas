  Tips
</h3>
<p>
  Here are a few tips for choosing and caring for garden furniture made from scaffold boards:
</p>

Pine is the most common type of wood used for scaffold boards, and it is a good choice for garden furniture because it is durable and resistant to rot. Spruce and fir are also good choices, but they are not as durable as pine.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Tip 2: Make sure the wood is treated.</strong> Scaffold boards are typically treated with a preservative to protect them from rot and decay. However, it is important to make sure that the wood is treated with a preservative that is suitable for outdoor use.
