  Many flatpack furniture pieces come with optional components or accessories that allow for further customization. For example, users may be able to choose different drawer handles, shelf heights, or add-on units to create a truly personalized furniture piece.
</p>
<p>

This can be done through painting, staining, or applying decorative elements to create a unique and cohesive living space.

  <strong>Tip 4: Store Furniture Properly During Off-Season:</strong>
</p>
<p>
  To extend the lifespan of your garden furniture, store it properly during the off-season. Clean the furniture thoroughly, dry it completely, and store it in a dry and sheltered location. If you don't have a storage space, cover the furniture with waterproof covers to protect it from the elements.
