  FAQ
</h3>
<p>
  Have questions about garden furniture? We've compiled a list of frequently asked questions to help you make informed decisions and enjoy your outdoor space to the fullest.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Question 1: What are the different types of garden furniture materials?</em></strong><br />
  Answer 1: Garden furniture comes in a variety of materials, each with its own unique properties. Common materials include wood (teak, cedar, and acacia), metal (iron, aluminum, and stainless steel), plastic (polyethylene and PVC), and wicker (natural and synthetic). Consider factors like durability, weather resistance, and maintenance when choosing the right material for your garden furniture.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Question 2: How do I choose garden furniture that is comfortable and stylish?</em></strong><br />
  Answer 2: Comfort and style go hand in hand when choosing garden furniture. Look for pieces with ergonomic designs that provide proper back support and ample cushioning. Pay attention to the overall style of the furniture and ensure it complements your garden's aesthetic.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Question 3: What are some tips for maintaining garden furniture?</em></strong><br />
  Answer 3: Regular maintenance can extend the lifespan of your garden furniture. Clean it periodically with a mild detergent and water, and apply protective treatments or sealants as recommended by the manufacturer. Store cushions and pillows indoors or in protective covers when not in use.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Question 4: How can I create a cohesive garden furniture arrangement?</em></strong><br />
  Answer 4: To create a cohesive look, consider the size and scale of your garden furniture. Arrange larger pieces, such as sofas or dining tables, as focal points and group smaller items, such as chairs and side tables, around them. Add accessories like cushions, throws, and plants to enhance the overall ambiance.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Question 5: What are some space-saving garden furniture ideas for small spaces?</em></strong><br />
  Answer 5: For small gardens, opt for compact and foldable furniture pieces that can be easily moved or stored away when not in use. Wall-mounted or hanging furniture can also save valuable floor space. Consider using multifunctional furniture, such as ottomans with built-in storage or benches with hidden compartments.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Question 6: How can I incorporate sustainable practices into my garden furniture choices?</em></strong><br />
  Answer 6: Choose garden furniture made from recycled or sustainable materials, such as bamboo, cork, or reclaimed wood. Look for furniture companies that prioritize eco-friendly manufacturing processes and consider purchasing second-hand or vintage pieces to reduce your environmental impact.
