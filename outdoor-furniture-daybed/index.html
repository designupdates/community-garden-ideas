<p>
  <strong>Tip 2: Choose the right materials.</strong> Garden furniture is made from a variety of materials, each with its own advantages and disadvantages. Wood is durable and beautiful, but it requires regular maintenance. Metal is also durable, but it can be heavy and hot to the touch. Plastic is lightweight and weather-resistant, but it can be flimsy. Wicker is lightweight and comfortable, but it can be damaged by rain and sun.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Tip 3: Consider the style of your garden.</strong> Your garden furniture should complement the style of your garden. If you have a traditional garden, you might want to choose furniture made from wood or metal. If you have a modern garden, you might want to choose furniture made from plastic or wicker.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Tip 4: Care for your garden furniture.</strong> To keep your garden furniture looking its best, you should clean it regularly with a mild soap and water solution. You should also protect your furniture from the elements by covering it when it is not in use.
