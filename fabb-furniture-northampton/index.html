<h3>
  Tips
</h3>
<p>
  Here are a few tips to help you choose the perfect garden furniture for your needs:
</p>
<p>
  <strong>1. Consider your needs</strong><br />
  The first step is to consider your needs. How many people will be using the furniture? What activities will you be using it for? What is the size of your outdoor space? Once you know your needs, you can start to narrow down your choices.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>2. Choose durable materials</strong><br />
  Garden furniture is exposed to the elements, so it's important to choose durable materials. Teak, acacia, eucalyptus, and rattan are all good choices for outdoor furniture. These materials are weather-resistant and can withstand fading, cracking, and warping.
</p>
<p>
