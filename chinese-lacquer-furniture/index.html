<h3>
  Natural lacquer resin

  Lacquer is a natural resin that is derived from the sap of the lacquer tree (Toxicodendron vernicifluum). The lacquer tree is native to China and Japan, and it has been cultivated for thousands of years for its valuable resin.
</p>
<p>
  Lacquer sap is collected by tapping the trunk of the lacquer tree. The sap is then filtered and refined to remove impurities. The resulting lacquer is a viscous liquid that can be applied to various surfaces, such as wood, bamboo, and metal.
</p>
<p>
  Lacquer is a very durable material that is resistant to water, heat, and insects. It also has a beautiful glossy finish that can be polished to a high shine. Lacquerware is often decorated with intricate designs and patterns, which are created by applying multiple layers of lacquer in different colors.

  </li>
  <li>Lacquer is a natural antiseptic, which means that it can help to prevent the growth of bacteria and mold.
  </li>
  <li>Lacquer is a fire retardant, which means that it can help to slow the spread of fire.
  </li>
</ul>
<h3>
  Meticulous craftsmanship
</h3>
<p>
  Chinese lacquer furniture is renowned for its meticulous craftsmanship. Each piece is a testament to the skill and artistry of the craftsmen who create it.
</p>
<p>
  The process of creating lacquer furniture is time-consuming and labor-intensive. It can take several months to complete a single piece. The first step is to prepare the surface of the furniture. This involves sanding the wood to a smooth finish and then applying a layer of gesso, which is a white primer made from plaster or chalk.
</p>
<p>
  Once the gesso has dried, the lacquer is applied. The lacquer is applied in multiple layers, each of which is allowed to dry before the next is applied. The number of layers can vary depending on the desired finish. A high-quality piece of lacquer furniture may have as many as 100 layers of lacquer.
</p>
<p>
  After the final layer of lacquer has been applied, the furniture is polished to a high shine. This is done by rubbing the furniture with a soft cloth or a piece of leather. The polishing process can take several hours to complete.
</p>
<p>
  The meticulous craftsmanship that goes into Chinese lacquer furniture is evident in the finished product. Lacquer furniture is beautiful, durable, and resistant to water, heat, and insects. It is also a valuable investment, as it can last for generations with proper care.
