  Before selecting garden furniture, take the time to assess your outdoor space. Measure the available area and consider the layout of your garden or patio. Choose furniture that is appropriately sized and will fit comfortably in your space without overcrowding it.

  Garden furniture should be comfortable and inviting. Choose pieces with ergonomic designs and supportive cushions. Consider adding outdoor rugs and throws to enhance comfort and create a cozy atmosphere.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Tip 4: Maintain Your Garden Furniture:</strong><br />
  Regular maintenance is essential to keep your garden furniture looking its best andå»¶é¿ing its lifespan. Clean your furniture periodically with mild detergent and water. Apply protective sealants or oils to wooden furniture to prevent cracking and fading. Store your furniture in a dry and covered area during off-seasons or inclement weather.
