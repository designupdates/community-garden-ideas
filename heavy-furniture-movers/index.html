</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Question 3: What's the best way to move heavy garden furniture?</em></strong><br />
  Answer 3: For heavy garden furniture, it's recommended to use a furniture dolly or hand truck. These tools make it easier to move heavy items without straining your back or risking injury. If the furniture is exceptionally heavy, consider hiring professional movers to ensure safe handling.

  <strong><em>Question 5: Can I move garden furniture myself, or should I hire professionals?</em></strong><br />
  Answer 5: If you have a few pieces of lightweight garden furniture and the necessary equipment, you may be able to move them yourself.

They have the expertise, equipment, and manpower to handle the move safely and efficiently.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Question 6: What should I do with my garden furniture after moving?</em></strong><br />
