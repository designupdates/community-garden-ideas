</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Return period.</strong> How long do you have to return the furniture if you're not satisfied? Some stores have a generous return policy that allows you to return furniture up to 30 days or even longer. Others have a shorter return period, such as 14 days or even less.

    <strong>Refund or exchange.</strong> What are your options if you return the furniture? Some stores offer a full refund, while others only offer an exchange. Be sure to find out the store's policy before you buy.

  <li>
    <strong>Exceptions.</strong> Are there any items that are not eligible for return? Some stores may have a policy that excludes certain items from return, such as clearance items or special orders.

<p>
  By checking the store's return policy before you buy, you can avoid any surprises if you need to return the furniture. You'll also be able to make an informed decision about whether or not the store's return policy is acceptable to you.

<h3>
  Consider delivery costs

White glove delivery costs can range from $150 to $300, depending on the size and weight of your furniture and the distance to your home.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Curbside delivery.</strong> This is the most affordable type of delivery, and it involves the delivery of your furniture to the curbside of your home. You will be responsible for bringing the furniture into your home yourself.

  Here are a few key points to remember:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Shop early for the best selection and prices.
  </li>
  <li>Compare prices from different stores before you buy.
  </li>
  <li>Negotiate with the salesperson if you're not happy with the price.
  </li>
  <li>Take advantage of doorbuster deals.
  </li>
</ul>
