</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Sustainable and Eco-Friendly:</strong><br />

    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Durability and Strength:</strong><br />
    <p>
      Reclaimed wood is often denser and stronger than new wood, as it has been exposed to the elements and seasoned over time. This results in furniture pieces that are built to last and can withstand the rigors of everyday use.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Versatile Design Options:</strong><br />
