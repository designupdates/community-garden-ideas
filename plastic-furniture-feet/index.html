</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Plastic furniture feet create a barrier between the furniture and the floor</strong><br />

    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Plastic furniture feet distribute the weight of the furniture evenly</strong><br />
    <p>
      When furniture is placed on the floor, the weight of the furniture is concentrated on a few small points. This can put a lot of stress on the floor and lead to scratches or dents. Plastic furniture feet distribute the weight of the furniture evenly, which helps to reduce the stress on the floor and prevent damage.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Plastic furniture feet are non-marking</strong><br />

</p>
<p>
  In addition, plastic furniture feet can also help to absorb sound. This is because plastic is a soft material that can absorb sound waves. This helps to reduce the amount of noise that is transmitted through the floor and into other rooms.
