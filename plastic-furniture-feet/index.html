</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Plastic furniture feet create a barrier between the furniture and the floor</strong><br />
    <p>
      When furniture is moved around, it can scratch or dent the floor. Plastic furniture feet create a barrier between the furniture and the floor, which helps to protect the floor from damage.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Plastic furniture feet distribute the weight of the furniture evenly</strong><br />
    <p>
      When furniture is placed on the floor, the weight of the furniture is concentrated on a few small points. This can put a lot of stress on the floor and lead to scratches or dents. Plastic furniture feet distribute the weight of the furniture evenly, which helps to reduce the stress on the floor and prevent damage.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Plastic furniture feet are non-marking</strong><br />

  When furniture is moved around on hard floors, it can create a lot of noise. This noise is caused by the friction between the furniture and the floor. Plastic furniture feet create a barrier between the furniture and the floor, which helps to reduce friction and noise.
</p>
<p>
  In addition, plastic furniture feet can also help to absorb sound. This is because plastic is a soft material that can absorb sound waves. This helps to reduce the amount of noise that is transmitted through the floor and into other rooms.
