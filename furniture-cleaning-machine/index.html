</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Agitation:</strong><br />
    <p>

  <li>
    <strong>Hot water extraction:</strong><br />
    <p>

    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Dry cleaning:</strong><br />
    <p>
      Dry cleaning machines use absorbent powders or foams to clean furniture and carpets. These powders or foams encapsulate dirt and debris, which are then vacuumed up, leaving the surface clean and refreshed.

  <li>
    <strong>Carpet cleaning:</strong><br />
    <p>
      Furniture cleaning machines can also be used to clean carpets effectively. They utilize powerful suction and rotating brushes to loosen and remove dirt, dust, and allergens from carpet fibers.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Hard floor cleaning:</strong><br />
    <p>
      Some furniture cleaning machines come with attachments that allow them to clean hard floors, such as tile, hardwood, and laminate. These attachments typically use a combination of brushes and suction to remove dirt and grime from hard surfaces.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Spot cleaning:</strong><br />
    <p>
      Furniture cleaning machines can also be used for spot cleaning specific stains on furniture or carpets. This is particularly useful for removing fresh stains before they set in and become more difficult to remove.
