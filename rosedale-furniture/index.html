  Regular maintenance is essential to extend the lifespan of your garden furniture and keep it looking its best. Clean your furniture periodically using mild soap and water, and apply protective finishes or sealants as recommended by the manufacturer. Store your furniture in a dry and covered area during harsh weather conditions or when not in use to protect it from the elements.
