  <strong>2. Make sure the cover fits properly.</strong> A properly fitting cover will provide complete protection for your furniture. If the cover is too loose, it will blow away in the wind. If the cover is too tight, it will be difficult to put on and take off.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>3. Keep your cover clean.</strong> A clean cover will last longer and protect your furniture better. Regularly wipe down your cover with a damp cloth or hose it off with water.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>4. Store your cover properly.</strong> When you're not using your cover, store it in a dry place. This will help to prevent the cover from fading or becoming damaged.
</p>
<p>
  By following these tips, you can choose and use made to measure covers to protect your garden furniture for many years to come.
</p>
<h3>
