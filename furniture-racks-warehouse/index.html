  <li>
    <strong>FIFO (First-In-First-Out) Inventory Management:</strong><br />
    <p>
      Furniture racks facilitate FIFO inventory management, ensuring that older inventory is used or sold first. This practice prevents stockpiling and spoilage, particularly important for perishable goods or products with limited shelf life.

Regular maintenance and proper storage during off-seasons will help extend the lifespan of your garden furniture and keep it looking its best.
</p>
<p>
  With careful planning and a little creativity, you can create a garden furniture setup that reflects your personality and provides a comfortable and stylish haven to unwind, entertain, and enjoy the outdoors.
</p>
<p>
  Remember, your garden furniture should be an extension of your indoor living space, inviting you to relax, recharge, and create lasting memories in the comfort of your own backyard.
