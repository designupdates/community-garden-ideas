</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Solid wood:</strong><br />
    <p>
      Ki furniture is typically made from solid wood, which is more durable and long-lasting than particle board or MDF. Common types of wood used in ki furniture include oak, maple, cherry, and walnut.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Natural finishes:</strong><br />
    <p>
      Ki furniture is often finished with natural oils or waxes, which help to protect the wood and bring out its natural beauty. These finishes are also more environmentally friendly than synthetic finishes.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Other natural materials:</strong><br />
    <p>
      In addition to wood, ki furniture may also incorporate other natural materials, such as bamboo, rattan, and leather. These materials add a unique touch to the furniture and make it even more sustainable.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Sustainable sourcing:</strong><br />
    <p>
      Many ki furniture makers use wood that has been harvested from sustainably managed forests. This means that the forests are managed in a way that ensures their long-term health and viability.

  </li>
</ul>
<p>

<h3>
  Sustainable harvesting
</h3>
<p>
  Sustainable harvesting is a key part of ki furniture making. Ki furniture makers use wood that has been harvested from sustainably managed forests. This means that the forests are managed in a way that ensures their long-term health and viability.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Selective harvesting:</strong><br />
    <p>
      Sustainable harvesting involves selectively harvesting trees, rather than clear-cutting entire forests. This helps to maintain the forest's biodiversity and allows the forest to regenerate naturally.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Reforestation:</strong><br />
    <p>
      Sustainable forestry also includes replanting trees that have been harvested. This ensures that the forest remains healthy and productive for future generations.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Forest certification:</strong><br />
    <p>
      Many ki furniture makers use wood that has been certified by a reputable forest certification organization, such as the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) or the Sustainable Forestry Initiative (SFI). This certification ensures that the wood has been harvested from a sustainably managed forest.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Reduced environmental impact:</strong><br />
    <p>
      Sustainable harvesting helps to reduce the environmental impact of ki furniture production. By using wood from sustainably managed forests, ki furniture makers help to protect forests and ensure that they are available for future generations.
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  By using wood that has been sustainably harvested, ki furniture makers create furniture that is both beautiful and sustainable. This makes ki furniture a great choice for those who want to create a home that is both stylish and environmentally friendly.
</p>
<h3>
  Traditional joinery
</h3>
<p>
  Traditional joinery is a key part of ki furniture making. Ki furniture makers use traditional joinery techniques to create furniture that is strong, durable, and beautiful.
</p>
<p>
  One of the most common traditional joinery techniques used in ki furniture making is the mortise and tenon joint. This joint is created by cutting a mortise (a square or rectangular hole) in one piece of wood and a tenon (a protruding tongue) on another piece of wood. The tenon is then inserted into the mortise and secured with glue or pegs.
</p>
<p>
  Another common traditional joinery technique used in ki furniture making is the dovetail joint. This joint is created by cutting a series of interlocking pins and tails on two pieces of wood. The pins and tails are then fitted together to create a strong and durable joint.
</p>
<p>
  Traditional joinery techniques are also used to create decorative elements on ki furniture. For example, ki furniture makers may use dovetail joints to create intricate patterns on the fronts of drawers or doors.
</p>
<p>
  Traditional joinery is a complex and skilled craft. Ki furniture makers who use traditional joinery techniques take great pride in their work. They know that the furniture they create will last for generations.
</p>
<p>
  The use of traditional joinery techniques is one of the things that makes ki furniture so special. Ki furniture is made to last, and it is built with the utmost care and attention to detail. If you are looking for furniture that is both beautiful and durable, ki furniture is a great option.
