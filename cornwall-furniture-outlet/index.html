<p>
  <strong>Tip 3: Measure your space.</strong> Before you buy any garden furniture, measure your outdoor space to make sure that the pieces you choose will fit comfortably. You should also consider the size of your walkways and doorways to make sure that you can easily move the furniture around.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Tip 4: Choose a style that complements your home.</strong> Your garden furniture should complement the style of your home and outdoor space. If you have a traditional home, you may want to choose furniture with a classic design. If you have a modern home, you may want to choose furniture with a more contemporary design.
