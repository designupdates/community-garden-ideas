  <strong><em>Question 2: How do I choose the right size garden furniture?</em></strong><br />
  Answer: When choosing garden furniture, it's important to consider the size of your outdoor space and the number of people you typically entertain. You should also think about the purpose of the furniture, such as whether you need a dining set, a lounge set, or a combination of both.

  Answer: The best way to care for your garden furniture is to clean it regularly with a mild soap and water solution. You should also protect it from the elements by covering it when not in use.

  Answer: Whether or not you can leave your garden furniture outside all year round depends on the material it is made from and the climate you live in.

You should also consider the size and shape of the cushions to ensure that they fit your furniture properly.

<p>
  <strong><em>Question 6: Where can I buy garden furniture?</em></strong><br />
