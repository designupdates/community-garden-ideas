  </li>
  <li>A dining table that is scratched or damaged can be sanded and refinished.
  </li>
  <li>A wardrobe that is no longer needed can be disassembled and the wood can be used to make new furniture.
  </li>
  <li>A mattress that is too old to be used can be recycled into new materials.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>
  Reduces landfill waste
</h3>
<p>
  Landfill waste is a major environmental problem. When organic materials, such as furniture, are sent to landfill, they decompose and produce methane gas. Methane is a greenhouse gas that is 25 times more potent than carbon dioxide. It is also a major contributor to climate change.
</p>
<p>
  The Stevenage Furniture Recycling Scheme helps to reduce landfill waste by diverting furniture from landfill and recycling it into new products. In 2021, the scheme diverted over 100 tonnes of furniture from landfill. This is equivalent to the weight of approximately 100 cars.
</p>
<p>
  By reducing landfill waste, the Stevenage Furniture Recycling Scheme helps to protect the environment and reduce climate change.
</p>
<p>
  Here are some additional benefits of reducing landfill waste:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Conserves natural resources</strong><br />
    <p>
      When furniture is recycled, it can be used to create new products, which reduces the need to extract and process raw materials.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Saves energy</strong><br />
    <p>
      Recycling furniture requires less energy than manufacturing new furniture from raw materials.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Reduces pollution</strong><br />
    <p>
      Landfill waste can pollute the air, water, and soil. Recycling furniture helps to reduce pollution and protect the environment.
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  The Stevenage Furniture Recycling Scheme is a great way to reduce landfill waste and protect the environment. By donating your old furniture to the scheme, you can help to make a positive impact on the planet.
</p>
