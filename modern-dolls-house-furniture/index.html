  Functional details
</h3>
<p>
  Modern dolls house furniture often incorporates functional details that add an extra level of realism and playability to the dollhouse. These details can include drawers that open, doors that swing, and windows that slide.
</p>

<h3>
  Scale and proportion
</h3>

  Scale and proportion are essential considerations when choosing modern dolls house furniture. The furniture should be in scale with the dollhouse and the dolls, and the proportions of the furniture should be realistic.
</p>
