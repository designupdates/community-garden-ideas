  FAQ
</h3>
<p>
  Here are some frequently asked questions about our garden furniture:
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Question 1: What materials are your garden furniture made from?</em></strong><br />
  Answer: Our garden furniture is made from a variety of high-quality materials, including teak, acacia, and aluminum. Teak is a durable hardwood that is naturally resistant to rot and decay, making it ideal for outdoor use. Acacia is another durable wood that is known for its beautiful grain patterns. Aluminum is a lightweight and rust-resistant metal that is perfect for outdoor furniture that will be exposed to the elements.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Question 2: How do I care for my garden furniture?</em></strong><br />
  Answer: The best way to care for your garden furniture is to clean it regularly with a mild soap and water solution. You should also apply a sealant or oil to the furniture on a regular basis to protect it from the elements. If your furniture is made from teak, you can simply let it weather naturally to develop a beautiful gray patina.
</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Question 3: What is your return policy?</em></strong><br />
  Answer: We offer a 30-day money-back guarantee on all of our garden furniture. If you are not satisfied with your purchase, you can return it for a full refund within 30 days of the purchase date.

</p>
<p>
  <strong>Tip 1: Choose the right materials</strong>
</p>
<p>
  The materials you choose for your garden furniture will have a big impact on its durability, comfort, and style. If you live in a climate with harsh winters, you will need to choose furniture that is weather-resistant. Teak, acacia, and aluminum are all good choices for outdoor furniture that will be exposed to the elements.
</p>

  <strong>Tip 2: Consider your comfort</strong>
</p>
<p>
  When choosing garden furniture, be sure to consider your comfort. The furniture should be comfortable to sit in and should provide adequate support. If you plan on spending a lot of time in your garden furniture, you may want to consider cushions or pillows for added comfort.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Tip 3: Choose a style that complements your home</strong>
</p>
<p>
  The style of your garden furniture should complement the style of your home. If you have a traditional home, you may want to choose classic garden furniture designs. If you have a modern home, you may want to choose more contemporary garden furniture designs.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Tip 4: Accessorize your garden furniture</strong>
</p>
<p>
  Accessorizing your garden furniture can help to create a more inviting and stylish outdoor space. You can add cushions, pillows, throws, and other accessories to your garden furniture to make it more comfortable and personal.
</p>
<p>
