  <strong>Tip 1: Choose the right materials</strong><br />
  When choosing garden furniture, consider the materials. Metal and wood furniture is generally the most durable, but you can also find furniture made from plastic, fiberglass, or fabric.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Tip 2: Consider your needs</strong><br />
  Think about how you will be using your garden furniture. If you plan on hosting large gatherings, you will need furniture that is durable and can seat a lot of people. If you have a small space, you may want to choose furniture that can be easily moved and stored.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Tip 3: Add comfort and style</strong><br />
  Make your garden furniture more comfortable and stylish by adding cushions, pillows, and throws. You can also add a rug to define the space and make it more inviting.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Tip 4: Protect your furniture</strong><br />
  To protect your garden furniture from the elements, you can use furniture covers, seal and stain wood furniture regularly, and store furniture indoors during harsh weather.
