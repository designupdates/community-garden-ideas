  Polywood is made from recycled plastic, primarily high-density polyethylene (HDPE), which is commonly used in milk jugs, detergent bottles, and other household items. By using recycled plastic, Polywood helps to divert waste from landfills and oceans, contributing to a cleaner and more sustainable planet.

Unlike traditional wood furniture, which requires the cutting down of trees, Polywood is made from recycled materials, reducing deforestation and preserving natural resources. Additionally, the production process emits fewer greenhouse gases compared to other materials such as aluminum or steel.
</p>
<p>
  Furthermore, Polywood furniture is durable and long-lasting, which means it doesn't need to be replaced as often as other materials. This reduces waste and the need for additional manufacturing, further contributing to sustainability. By choosing Polywood garden furniture, you can enjoy a beautiful and functional outdoor space while making a positive impact on the environment.
</p>
