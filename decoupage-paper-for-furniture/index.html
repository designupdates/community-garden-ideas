  Easy to apply and remove.
</h3>
<p>
  Decoupage paper for furniture is incredibly user-friendly, making it a great choice for both beginners and experienced crafters. Applying decoupage paper is a straightforward process that can be easily mastered with a few simple steps.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Cut the decoupage paper to the desired size and shape.</strong><br />
    <p>
      Use a sharp craft knife or scissors to precisely cut the decoupage paper to fit the surface you want to decorate.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Apply a coat of decoupage medium to the surface.</strong><br />
    <p>
      Use a brush to apply a thin, even coat of decoupage medium to the surface of the furniture. This will help the decoupage paper adhere properly.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Place the decoupage paper onto the surface.</strong><br />
    <p>
      Carefully position the decoupage paper onto the surface, ensuring that it is straight and smooth. Use your fingers or a soft cloth to gently press the decoupage paper onto the surface, removing any air bubbles.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Apply a top coat of decoupage medium.</strong><br />
    <p>
      Once the decoupage paper is in place, apply a coat of decoupage medium over the entire surface. This will seal the decoupage paper and protect it from wear and tear.
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  Removing decoupage paper is just as easy as applying it. Simply soak the surface with warm water and gently scrape off the decoupage paper using a plastic scraper or your fingernails. Once the decoupage paper is removed, you can clean the surface and start over with a new design.
