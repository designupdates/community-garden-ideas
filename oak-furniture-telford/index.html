Wicker is a natural material that adds a touch of style to any outdoor space, but it's not as weather-resistant as other materials.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Tip 2: Measure your space before you buy:</strong><br />
  Make sure you know how much space you have for your garden furniture before you start shopping. This will help you avoid buying pieces that are too big or too small for your space. It's also a good idea to consider the layout of your outdoor space and how you want to use it. For example, if you want to create a cozy conversation area, you'll need comfortable seating and a coffee table. If you're planning on hosting large gatherings, you'll need a dining table and chairs that can accommodate everyone.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Tip 3: Consider comfort and style:</strong><br />
  Garden furniture should be comfortable and stylish. After all, you'll be spending a lot of time relaxing in it. Look for pieces that are made from high-quality materials and that have comfortable cushions and padding. You should also choose pieces that match your personal style and the overall look of your outdoor space.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Tip 4: Protect your garden furniture from the elements:</strong><br />
  To extend the life of your garden furniture, it's important to protect it from the elements. This means cleaning it regularly, applying protective coatings, and storing it properly during the off-season. If you live in a climate with harsh winters, it's best to store your garden furniture indoors during the winter months. You can also use covers to protect your furniture from rain, snow, and dust.
</p>

  By following these tips, you can choose and care for your garden furniture to ensure that you can enjoy your outdoor space for years to come.
