<p>
  <strong><em>Question 2: What are the different types of garden furniture materials?</em></strong><br />
  Answer 2: Garden furniture is commonly made from materials like wood, metal, plastic, and wicker. Wood offers a classic and natural look but requires regular maintenance.

</p>
<p>
  <strong><em>Question 3: How can I protect my garden furniture from the elements?</em></strong><br />
  Answer 3: To protect your garden furniture from the elements, consider using weather-resistant covers or storing it indoors during harsh weather conditions.
