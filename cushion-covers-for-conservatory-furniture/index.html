  Protect from harsh weather
</h3>
<p>
  Conservatory furniture, when exposed to the elements, faces the brunt of harsh weather conditions. The sun's powerful UV rays can cause fading and deterioration of the fabric, while rain, snow, and wind can lead to mildew, rot, and other damage. Cushion covers provide a protective barrier against these elements, shielding the furniture from their harmful effects.

  <li>
    <strong>Repel rain and moisture:</strong><br />
    <p>
      Cushion covers made from water-resistant or waterproof materials effectively repel rain and moisture, preventing the growth of mold and mildew. This ensures that your cushions remain dry and comfortable, even after exposure to rain or snow.

    <strong>Protect from extreme temperatures:</strong><br />
    <p>
      Cushion covers provide an extra layer of insulation, protecting the furniture from extreme temperatures. This is especially important in conservatories that experience wide temperature fluctuations, as it helps prevent cracking and warping of the fabric.

</p>
<p>
  <strong>Fade-resistant:</strong><br />
  High-quality cushion covers are often fade-resistant, meaning they won't lose their color or vibrancy over time, even when exposed to the sun.

Fade-resistant cushion covers will maintain their appearance for longer, saving you the need to replace them frequently.
</p>
